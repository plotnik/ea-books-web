== Chapter 2 - Introduction to NumPy

This chapter provides an introduction to the Python NumPy library, demonstrating its importance in scientific computing and its common use in TensorFlow scripts. It covers topics such as arrays, loops, list operations, and the differences between NumPy arrays and Python lists. It introduces concepts such as dot products, the reshape() method, subranges, and linear regression, explaining how to calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) using NumPy's `linspace()` API.

NumPy is a powerful Python library that offers multi-dimensional arrays and a wide array of mathematical functions to perform operations on these arrays efficiently. It is particularly useful for tasks in machine learning where large datasets and mathematical computations are common.

Key NumPy features include ndarray objects, which are multi-dimensional arrays of homogeneous data types optimized for performance. The chapter illustrates various operations on NumPy arrays with code samples, showing how to append elements to arrays, multiply lists and arrays, compute exponents, and perform math operations with arrays.

The chapter also introduces the use of negative indices in subranges for arrays and vectors, and other useful NumPy methods like `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.empty`, `np.arange`, `np.shape`, `np.mean`, and `np.std`.

Linear regression is explored, explaining the concept and how to calculate the MSE using NumPy. The chapter also touches on the use of Google Colaboratory for running Python code with GPU support.

In summary, the chapter provides a foundational understanding of how NumPy can enhance Python's capabilities for handling numerical data, highlighting its significance in data analysis and machine learning applications.

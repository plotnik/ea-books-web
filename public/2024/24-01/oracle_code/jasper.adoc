== Introduction to Jaspersoft Studio

> https://community.jaspersoft.com/knowledgebase/getting-started/introduction-jaspersoft-studio/

Jaspersoft Studio is a report designer tool that can be used either as a standalone application or as an Eclipse plug-in to design JasperReports Library and JasperReports Server reports. It offers a visual layout for creating complex reports with elements like charts, images, and subreports, and supports various data sources such as JDBC, JavaBeans, XML, CSV, and more. Users can publish reports in multiple formats, including PDF, RTF, and HTML.

JasperReports Server extends JasperReports Library to offer a full suite of Business Intelligence (BI) functionalities, including interactive reporting, report serving, and data analysis. It can seamlessly integrate with other applications and allows for customization.

Reports are created in a JRXML file, which must be compiled into a Jasper file before execution. JasperReports processes the Jasper file with a data source to generate the final document. Jaspersoft Studio and iReport Designer provide tools for testing and previewing reports.

The user interface of Jaspersoft Studio is based on Eclipse and includes a main report editing area, a multi-tab editor with Design, Source, and Preview tabs, and various views such as Repository Explorer, Project Explorer, and Properties view. The platform also provides a summary of report state and information on errors during report compilation and execution.

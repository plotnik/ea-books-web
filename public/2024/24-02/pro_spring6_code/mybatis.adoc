> https://www.baeldung.com/mybatis

This article provides an overview of MyBatis, an open-source persistence framework for Java that simplifies database access and offers an alternative to JDBC and Hibernate. It guides through adding MyBatis to a project using Maven dependencies, explains core concepts like `SQLSessionFactory` and `SQLSession`, and introduces the concept of Mappers, which are Java interfaces that map methods to SQL statements. The article also details various annotations provided by MyBatis for defining SQL operations, result mappings, and dynamic SQL generation for complex queries. Additionally, it covers executing stored procedures using the `@Select` annotation. The tutorial emphasizes MyBatis's ability to ease the development of database-facing applications through its features and annotations.

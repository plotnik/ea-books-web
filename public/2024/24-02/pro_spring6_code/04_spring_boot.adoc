---
This chapter delves deeper into Spring Core's capabilities beyond basic Inversion of Control (IoC), exploring various services that supplement and extend its core functionalities.

Specifically, it will cover:

*   **Managing the bean life cycle**: Strategies for beans to receive notifications from the Spring container at different life cycle points, using interfaces, reflection, or JavaBeans annotations.
*   **Making beans "Spring aware"**: How beans can interact with their `ApplicationContext` instance using interfaces like `BeanNameAware` and `ApplicationContextAware`.
*   **Using FactoryBeans**: Implementing beans that act as factories for other beans, integrating with the Spring `BeanFactory`.
*   **Working with JavaBeans PropertyEditor implementations**: Understanding how Spring uses `PropertyEditors` for type conversion, including supplied and custom implementations.
*   **Learning more about the Spring ApplicationContext**: A detailed look at `ApplicationContext`'s additional features beyond IoC, such as internationalized message support, resource loading, and event publishing, including its use in web applications.
*   **Testing Spring applications**: Methods for creating Spring test contexts to effectively test Spring applications.
*   **Using Spring Boot**: How Spring Boot simplifies the creation of stand-alone, production-grade Spring applications.
*   **Using configuration enhancements**: Features like profile management and environment/property source abstraction to streamline application configuration.
*   **Using Groovy for configuration**: Exploring Groovy as an alternative or supplement to XML and Java-based bean configuration.

1.  What are the three distinct strategies presented in this chapter for enabling Spring beans to receive notifications from the container at various points throughout their life cycles?
2.  Which two specific interfaces does Spring offer to make a bean "Spring aware" by allowing it to obtain its assigned name and reference its `ApplicationContext` instance, as discussed in this chapter?
3.  According to this chapter, which specific Spring version introduced the ability to configure bean definitions using the Groovy language, and how is this approach positioned as an alternative or supplement to existing configuration styles?

== Prepare Your Development Environment

To start running the code from the book, follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure you are seated comfortably at your computer.
   - Install JDK 17 and verify it is set as the default by running `java -version` in your terminal; the output should indicate Java version 17.

2. **Project Setup**:
   - Clone the project repository or download and unzip the sources from Apress. You should have a directory named `pro-spring-6`, which contains various modules.

3. **IDE Configuration**:
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA, select File ➤ Open, and choose the `pro-spring-6` directory. You will see the project and its modules in the Project View, along with Gradle and Maven configurations.

4. **Project Details**:
   - The project consists of multiple modules, each representing a chapter. Modules ending in "-boot" are Spring Boot projects, while others are classic Spring projects, which can be used independently of Spring Boot.
   - The project includes configurations for both Gradle (version 7.4) and Maven (version 3.8.4), and these are set up to use wrappers, so you don’t need to install them locally.

5. **Building the Project**:
   - You can build the project following the instructions in the `README.adoc` file. IntelliJ IDEA recognizes the wrapper configurations for building.
   - If you encounter issues with missing dependencies, try building from the command line or use options like **Invalidate Caches** or **Reload All from Disk** in the File menu.

After successfully loading and building the project, further details about Spring internals and the project configurations will be provided.

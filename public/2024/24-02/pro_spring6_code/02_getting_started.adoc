== Prepare Your Development Environment

To start running the code from the book, follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure you are seated comfortably at your computer.
   - Install JDK 17 and verify it is set as the default by running `java -version` in your terminal; the output should indicate Java version 17.

2. **Project Setup**:
   - Clone the project repository or download and unzip the sources from Apress. You should have a directory named `pro-spring-6`, which contains various modules.

3. **IDE Configuration**:
   - Open IntelliJ IDEA, select File ➤ Open, and choose the `pro-spring-6` directory. You will see the project and its modules in the Project View, along with Gradle and Maven configurations.

4. **Project Details**:
   - The project consists of multiple modules, each representing a chapter. Modules ending in "-boot" are Spring Boot projects, while others are classic Spring projects, which can be used independently of Spring Boot.
   - The project includes configurations for both Gradle (version 7.4) and Maven (version 3.8.4), and these are set up to use wrappers, so you don’t need to install them locally.

5. **Building the Project**:
   - You can build the project following the instructions in the `README.adoc` file. IntelliJ IDEA recognizes the wrapper configurations for building.
   - If you encounter issues with missing dependencies, try building from the command line or use options like **Invalidate Caches** or **Reload All from Disk** in the File menu.

After successfully loading and building the project, further details about Spring internals and the project configurations will be provided.

== Understanding Spring Packaging

The Spring framework offers a modular packaging system, allowing developers to select only the necessary components for their applications. Each component is packaged in a JAR file, which includes compiled code, Javadoc, and source files. IntelliJ IDEA facilitates this by scanning project dependencies and enabling users to download sources and Javadocs for better code visibility.

The framework consists of 22 modules, each serving specific functionalities, such as AOP, JDBC, transaction management, and web application support. Notable modules include:

- **aop**: For Spring's AOP features.
- **jdbc**: For JDBC support and database access.
- **webmvc**: For Spring's MVC framework.

For Spring Boot users, module selection is automatic through starter dependencies that simplify the setup process for common application types. These starters encapsulate necessary dependencies and configurations, such as `spring-boot-starter-web` for web applications and `spring-boot-starter-data-*` for data handling, thus streamlining the development process.

Overall, Spring's modular architecture and the convenience of Spring Boot starters provide a flexible and efficient way to build applications tailored to specific needs.

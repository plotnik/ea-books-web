:icons: font
:toc: left

Chapters 1 and 2 introduce the Spring framework, emphasizing its role in simplifying dependency injection (DI) through the principle of inversion of control (IoC), where components rely on an external service to provide their dependencies. This design pattern allows for a cleaner separation of concerns. The chapter outlines various IoC concepts, differentiating between dependency injection and dependency lookup, and discusses their respective advantages and disadvantages.

Key features covered include:

- **IoC Concepts**: An overview of different IoC types, including their pros and cons.
- **IoC in Spring**: An explanation of Spring's IoC capabilities and the types of dependency injection it supports, such as setter, constructor, and method injection.
- **Spring's DI Implementation**: A focus on the IoC container, particularly the `BeanFactory` and the more advanced `ApplicationContext`, which offers enhanced functionalities.
- **Configuring Spring Context**: Guidance on using annotations for configuring the ApplicationContext, with a preview of Groovy and Java configurations to be explored in Chapter 4. The discussion includes DI configuration and additional services from `BeanFactory`, like bean inheritance and lifecycle management.

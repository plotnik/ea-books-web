In this course section, we will delve deeper into key React concepts covered previously. We will examine JSX and non-JSX code, revisit Components and State for better structure, and explore advanced state usage, patterns, and best practices. We'll start by enhancing the demo application from the last section, and later, we'll build a tic-tac-toe game to explore advanced concepts.

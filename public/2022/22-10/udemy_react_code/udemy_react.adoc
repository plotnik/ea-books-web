== 5. React Essentials - Practice Project

This course section focuses on practicing essential React skills by building a new demo project: an Investment Calculator web app. Unlike previous sections, this part does not introduce new concepts but allows learners to apply their knowledge of components, state, and conditional rendering. A starting project is provided, available in both local and CodeSandbox versions, which includes pre-written CSS to ease the design process. Additionally, a utility file with a function for calculating investment results and a formatter for number styling is included to help learners focus on React concepts rather than calculations.

The main goal is for learners to independently develop the web app, with the understanding that multiple solutions are possible. They are encouraged to take their time and embrace the learning process, including potential challenges. Following this practice, the instructor will provide a walkthrough of their solution, emphasizing that it is just one way to approach the project.

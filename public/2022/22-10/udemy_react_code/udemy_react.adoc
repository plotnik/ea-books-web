=== 105. Module Introduction & Starting Project

The section focuses on styling React components and applications, emphasizing that it is not a CSS course but an introduction to applying CSS within React. It outlines various options for styling, starting with Vanilla CSS, and then progressing to more advanced techniques. Key topics include:

- **CSS Modules** for scoping styles to specific components.
- **Styled Components**, a CSS-in-JS library, exploring its benefits and drawbacks.
- **Tailwind CSS**, a popular utility-first CSS framework for styling React apps.

The course will cover both static styles and dynamic, conditional styles. A starting project is provided for hands-on practice, which includes basic styling with Vanilla CSS. Participants will learn how to set up the project and see some initial styles applied, although some interactive elements like account creation and sign-in will not function yet. The next lecture will begin with applying styles using Vanilla CSS.

== 4. React Essentials - Deep Dive

=== 60. Module Introduction

In this course section, we will delve deeper into key React concepts covered previously. We will examine JSX and non-JSX code, revisit Components and State for better structure, and explore advanced state usage, patterns, and best practices. We'll start by enhancing the demo application from the last section, and later, we'll build a tic-tac-toe game to explore advanced concepts.

=== 61. You Don't Have To Use JSX!

This section discusses JSX code in React, emphasizing that while JSX is a non-standard feature not directly supported by browsers, it simplifies the development process. JSX code is transformed by a build process into browser-compatible code. Although it's possible to create React applications without JSX using the `createElement` method from React, this approach is more verbose and less intuitive. Most React projects, including those in this course, will utilize JSX for its convenience and readability. The text also highlights that using the non-JSX method requires no build process but is typically more complex. A practical example is provided, demonstrating how to create a root component using both JSX and the non-JSX approach while achieving the same result on screen.

=== 62. Working with Fragments

The discussion focuses on JSX and its requirement for a single parent element in a return statement. In an example using a `div` to wrap sibling elements, it is explained that removing the `div` leads to an error because JSX must return one parent element. This limitation is likened to JavaScript's inability to return multiple values from a function. To avoid unnecessary DOM elements, React provides a `Fragment` component, which can be used as a wrapper without rendering an actual element. Additionally, modern React projects allow for an even shorter syntax using empty tags to achieve the same effect without extra code or DOM elements.

=== 63. When Should You Split Components

The discussion focuses on the challenges of managing a large React component, specifically the `App` component, which has multiple responsibilities such as rendering core concepts, managing tap buttons, and handling interactive states. The current structure leads to inefficiencies, as state updates cause unnecessary re-executions of the header component, resulting in unintended behavior like generating a new random number each time. This indicates the need to split the app component into smaller, more focused sub-components to better manage responsibilities and improve performance, a crucial skill for React developers.

=== 64. Splitting Components By Feature & State

The text discusses breaking down a large React App Component into smaller, more manageable components, which is a common best practice in React development. The process involves creating two new components: `CoreConcepts` and `Examples`. 

1. **Core Concepts Component**: 
   - The relevant section of the App Component is cut out and pasted into a new `CoreConcepts.jsx` file.
   - The component imports necessary data and exports a function that returns the JSX for Core Concepts.

2. **Examples Component**: 
   - Similarly, the section for examples, including tab buttons and content, is transferred to a new `Examples.jsx` file.
   - This component also handles its own state and imports necessary data and React hooks.

3. **App Component Adjustments**: 
   - The App Component is cleaned up by removing imports related to the now-extracted features and importing the new components instead.
   - The state management for the tab content is moved to the Examples Component, which affects how the application behaves when tabs are clicked.

The overall goal is to create a leaner App Component by distributing features across smaller components, making the codebase easier to manage, especially in larger projects. After these changes, the application should function identically to before, without errors, while now having a more organized structure.

=== 65. Problem - Props Are Not Forwarded To Inner Elements

In this section, the focus is on enhancing an existing React application by creating a reusable `Section` component. The idea is to maintain a consistent structure for sections in the application, which typically includes a title and content. The `Section` component will accept `props`, specifically a `title` and `children`, allowing for dynamic content rendering.

The process involves:

1. Creating a `section.jsx` file in the components folder.
2. Defining the `Section` component to return a section element with an `h2` title and the content passed through `children`.
3. Importing and using the `Section` component in the `examples.jsx` file, replacing existing section markup with the new component.

However, an issue arises with styling because when props are set on a custom component, they are not automatically forwarded to the underlying HTML elements. This results in lost styling, as the `ID` prop set on the `Section` component was not passed to the actual section element.

To resolve this, it's suggested to destructure and manually pass props like `ID` and `className` to the built-in section element. However, this approach can become cumbersome with multiple attributes. A more scalable solution involves using a pattern known as "forwarding props," which allows for easier management of attributes without needing to manually destructure each one.

=== 66. Forwarding Props To Wrapped Elements

The passage explains how to use JavaScript's destructuring and spread syntax when creating custom components in React. By using the spread operator (three dots), developers can collect all additional props passed to a component and merge them into a `props` object. This allows for forwarding those props to built-in elements, maintaining flexibility in the component's usage without manually extracting each prop.

The example specifically discusses a `Section` component that utilizes this pattern to forward various props like ID and class name to a built-in `Section` element. It highlights the benefits of this approach in creating wrapper components, ensuring they remain functional and flexible. The same technique can be applied to other components, such as `TabButton`, by spreading any remaining props onto a built-in button and replacing custom props with standard ones (e.g., replacing `onSelect` with `onClick`). This maintains the original functionality while simplifying prop management in the components.

=== 67. Working with Multiple JSX Slots

The section discusses the creation of a reusable tabs component in a React project, emphasizing the props forwarding pattern. The current setup for tabs consists of a menu bar with buttons and content displayed below, which may work for simple applications but could become cumbersome in larger ones. 

To improve reusability, a new `Tabs` component is proposed, allowing the use of prop destructuring to manage dynamic tab content. The author suggests managing tab button clicks and content outside the `Tabs` component to maintain its status as a "dumb" wrapper. 

To accomplish this, an additional prop (e.g., `buttons`) is introduced to allow passing tab buttons as JSX, alongside a `children` prop for content. This enables the `Tabs` component to have a clear structure: buttons inside a menu element and content below it. The example demonstrates how to implement this pattern, which, although seemingly redundant for simple applications, is essential for scalable React development.

=== 68. Setting Component Types Dynamically

The discussion focuses on enhancing a Tabs component by allowing it to accept a `buttonsContainer` prop that determines the wrapper element for buttons within the component. This approach aims to improve flexibility, enabling developers to choose different wrapper elements (like `menu`, `ul`, `div`, or custom components) when using the Tabs component in various parts of an application.

To implement this, the idea is to create a variable that starts with a capital letter (e.g., `ButtonsContainer`) to reference the `buttonsContainer` prop within the component. This allows React to treat the prop's value correctly, whether it's a built-in HTML element or a custom component. 

Key points to remember include:

- Built-in elements should be passed as string identifiers (e.g., "menu").
- Custom components should be passed as identifiers without angle brackets, and they must start with an uppercase character to be recognized as components.

This pattern enhances the reusability of the Tabs component while maintaining a clean separation between buttons and content.

=== 69. Setting Default Prop Values

The discussion focuses on the concept of default prop values in React, specifically using the Tabs component. The ButtonsContainer prop, which designates a wrapper for buttons, is highlighted as an example where a default value can enhance usability. By utilizing destructuring syntax in the component definition, a default value (such as "menu") can be assigned to the `ButtonsContainer` prop. This allows the Tabs component to function without explicitly setting the ButtonsContainer, thereby simplifying its usage while maintaining the same functionality. The example demonstrates that even without specifying the prop, the Tabs component defaults to using the menu element as the wrapper.

=== Coding Exercise 15: Creating Flexible Components

```
export default function Button({ children, mode="filled", Icon, ...props }) {
    const noIconClass = `button ${mode}-button`;
    const withIconClass = noIconClass + " icon-button";
    return (
        <button className={Icon ? withIconClass : noIconClass} {...props}>
            {
                Icon ?
                <span className="button-icon"><Icon /></span> :
                ''
            }
            <span>{children}</span>
        </button>
    )
}
```

== 131. Module Introduction & Starting Project

Summary:

* Focus: React Refs and Portals—optional but powerful tools for specific
problems.
* Refs:
** Provide direct access to DOM elements.
** Store mutable values that shouldn’t trigger re-renders (not state).
** Let components expose an API (e.g., callable functions) to other
components.
* Portals:
** Render elements in a different place in the DOM than where they
appear in JSX (e.g., modals/overlays).
* Demo project:
** Build a timer challenge game using Refs, Portals, components, and
state.
** Starter projects available (local and CodeSandbox).
** Initial setup includes a basic App and Player component; the input’s
“Set Name” button doesn’t work yet—fixing it will be the first Refs
example.

=== Andrew Ng

Andrew Ng shares his excitement about the potential of AI for building applications as we approach 2025. He highlights how AI is simplifying the software prototyping process, lowering development costs, and enabling quicker testing of ideas. Ng notes that AI-assisted coding is particularly effective for creating stand-alone prototypes, while larger systems remain more complex due to the need for reliability and context.

He mentions various platforms that help with deployment and emphasizes the importance of learning and building in the coming year. Ng encourages his audience to create a learning plan and to start building prototypes, regardless of their current coding skills, as even small projects can lead to valuable learning experiences. He concludes with well wishes for the New Year and a playful nod to programming in Python and JavaScript.

=== Joseph Gonzalez: General Intelligence

Joseph Gonzalez anticipates that by 2025, the advancement of foundational AI models will slow due to scaling limits and rising inference costs. Instead, he expects significant innovation in AI applications, particularly with AI agents and their integration with existing systems, leading to new capabilities and products. He argues that we have achieved a form of artificial general intelligence (AGI), characterized by the generality of current AI systems, allowing them to perform a wide range of tasks effectively.

Gonzalez emphasizes the trend towards becoming "AI-native," where users increasingly interact with AI for personalized solutions, as seen in educational contexts and technical support. He predicts that organizations will shift focus from exploration to demonstrating the tangible value of AI investments, driving a race to incorporate AI effectively into products and services.

He hopes that by 2025, AI will evolve beyond simple chat interactions to become more integrated into daily tasks, functioning invisibly to assist users and enhance decision-making. Ultimately, Gonzalez envisions a future where AI agents support human interactions, allowing people to focus on what truly matters.

== Introduction

This book is a practical guide to building modern web applications using React and Firebase. The author, a German software and web engineer with extensive experience in JavaScript and teaching, shares his knowledge on creating frontend applications with React and replacing backend tech stacks with Firebase, which provides database, authentication, authorization, and hosting services. The book is aimed at both newcomers to React and experienced developers looking to bootstrap business ideas with a minimal viable product (MVP). Readers will learn how to build a real-world application with user management, authentication flows, and interaction with Firebase's database.

To benefit from this book, readers should be familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and APIs. The author's other book, "The Road to learn React," is recommended for learning React fundamentals. The book includes FAQs, guidance on how to get updates and additional learning material, and offers a money-back guarantee. There is also a Slack community for support and a call for feedback and contributions to improve the content.

The author emphasizes a hands-on approach, encourages readers to type out code instead of copying and pasting, and to learn through practical experience and overcoming challenges. The book aims to provide readers with the skills necessary to build sophisticated applications using a minimalistic tech stack, without worrying about backend implementation. The author's motivation is to offer up-to-date, comprehensive, and practical teaching on web development technologies, supporting a diverse range of developers.

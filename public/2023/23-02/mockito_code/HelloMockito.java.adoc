----

The `HelloMockito` class in the provided Java code is designed to offer
greeting services, potentially in different languages, and demonstrates
dependency injection, use of interfaces, and optional handling. It’s
structured to work within a hypothetical system where `Person` objects
are stored and retrieved, and translations are performed by a
translation service. Below is an explanation of its components and
functionalities:

== Dependencies

* *`PersonRepository`*: An interface (assumed from the context) for
managing `Person` objects, including retrieving them by ID.
* *`TranslationService`*: An interface for translating text from one
language to another.
* *`DefaultTranslationService`*: A concrete implementation of
`TranslationService`, used as a default if no translation service is
explicitly provided.
* *`InMemoryPersonRepository`*: A concrete implementation of
`PersonRepository`, presumably storing `Person` objects in memory.

== Constructors

The class includes multiple constructors, demonstrating overloading and
the use of `this` to chain them for dependency injection:

[arabic]
. *Primary Constructor*: Accepts both a `PersonRepository` and a
`TranslationService`, allowing external configuration of these
dependencies.
. *Convenience Constructor for PersonRepository*: Accepts only a
`PersonRepository` and uses a default `TranslationService`.
. *Convenience Constructor for TranslationService*: Accepts only a
`TranslationService` and uses an in-memory person repository.

== Methods

* *`greet(int id, String sourceLanguage, String targetLanguage)`*: This
method attempts to find a `Person` by ID using the `PersonRepository`.
If found, it uses the person’s first name in the greeting; otherwise, it
defaults to ``World''. The greeting is then translated using the
provided languages and the `TranslationService`.
* *`greet(int id)`*: An overloaded version of the `greet` method that
likely translates the greeting to a default language, as it doesn’t
accept language parameters. It’s marked as unused, suggesting it might
be for demonstration or future use.
* *`greet(Person person, String sourceLanguage, String targetLanguage)`*:
Directly greets the provided `Person` object, translating the greeting
into the specified languages.
* *`setGreeting(String greeting)`* and *`getGreeting()`*: Methods to
update and retrieve the greeting template. This allows for customization
of the greeting message.

== Key Concepts Demonstrated

* *Dependency Injection*: The class demonstrates dependency injection
both through its constructors and by allowing the injection of a custom
greeting message. This design principle helps in making the code more
modular, testable, and flexible.
* *Optional Handling*: The use of `Optional` for handling the
possibility of a `Person` not being found is a good practice for
avoiding `NullPointerException`.
* *Interface-based Design*: By depending on interfaces
(`PersonRepository` and `TranslationService`) rather than concrete
implementations, the class is more adaptable to changes in the way
persons are stored or translations are performed.

== Usage Scenario

This class could be used in an application that requires greeting users
in different languages, possibly based on user preferences or settings.
The flexibility in specifying different repositories and translation
services makes it suitable for various contexts, including web
applications, desktop applications, or even command-line tools.

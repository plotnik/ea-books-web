== 1 What is deep learning?

=== 1.1 Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning

The layer's function in processing input data is determined by its _weights_, which are numerical values. Technically, the layer's operation is _parameterized_ by these weights, which can also be referred to as the layer's _parameters_.

_Learning_ in this context involves identifying the proper values for the weights across all layers in a network so that the network accurately associates input examples with their corresponding targets.

To manage the output of a neural network, it's essential to monitor it, which is done through a _loss function_. The loss function evaluates the network's predictions against the desired targets by calculating a distance score, indicating the network's performance on a given example. This function is also known as the _objective function_ or _cost function_.

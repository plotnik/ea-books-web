== 3. Getting started with AWS

=== 3.1 AWS Cloud Overview - Regions & AZ

The history of AWS Cloud began in 2002 when it was launched internally at Amazon.com, recognizing the potential to offer IT services externally. Its first public offering was SQS in 2004, expanding in 2006 with the addition of S3 and EC2. AWS has since grown to serve global clients including notable names like Dropbox, Netflix, Airbnb, and NASA. As of 2019, AWS led the cloud market with $35 billion in annual revenue and a 47% market share, outpacing competitors like Microsoft and Google. AWS offers a wide range of services enabling the construction of sophisticated and scalable applications across various industries. The platform's global infrastructure includes regions, availability zones, data centers, edge locations, and points of presence, supporting a vast network that spans the globe. AWS regions are clusters of data centers located worldwide, and when choosing a region for deployment, factors such as compliance, latency, service availability, and pricing must be considered. Each region contains multiple availability zones for redundancy and disaster isolation. AWS also operates over 400 points of presence in 90 cities across 40 countries to minimize latency for end-users. AWS services are primarily region-scoped, with some global services like IAM, Route 53, CloudFront, and WAF available. To check service availability in a specific region, AWS provides a region table for reference.

=== 3.2 Tour of the AWS Console & Services in AWS

The content provides an introductory guide to navigating the AWS Console Home. Key points include:

- **Region Selection:** Users are advised to select the AWS region closest to their geographic location to minimize latency. The example mentions Northern Virginia (US East 1) and points out that users in Europe might prefer Ireland (EU West 1), whereas users near Africa might choose the Capetown region.
  
- **Console Overview:** The AWS Console displays a list of recently visited services, which may be empty for new users, and provides information on AWS health issues, account cost and usage, and tutorials.

- **Services Navigation:** Users can explore AWS services by clicking on the "Services" tab, which allows browsing either in alphabetical order or by category. A search bar is also available for finding services directly, such as Route 53, and accessing specific features within those services.

- **Global vs. Regional Services:** Some AWS services, like Route 53, are classified as "global" and do not require region selection. In contrast, services like EC2 will display resources based on the selected region, emphasizing the importance of consistent region selection throughout the tutorial or course.

- **AWS Global Infrastructure:** The document suggests consulting the AWS Global Infrastructure online for information about service availability in different regions, highlighting that not all AWS services are available in every region.

The guide emphasizes the importance of region selection for optimizing latency, familiarizes users with the AWS Console layout and navigation, and introduces the concept of global versus regional services, along with resources for checking service availability by region.

== 4. IAM & AWS CLI

=== 4.1. IAM Introduction - Users, Groups, Policies

The provided text introduces the concept of Identity and Access Management (IAM) in AWS, emphasizing its role in managing users and their permissions within an organization. IAM is described as a global service that allows the creation of user accounts and groups to organize users. The text illustrates this by mentioning a hypothetical organization with six people, where individuals are assigned to groups based on their roles, such as developers or operations. It's mentioned that groups can only contain users, not other groups, and a user can be part of multiple groups.

IAM policies, defined through JSON documents, are used to assign specific permissions to users or groups, enabling them to access and use AWS services like EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, and CloudWatch. The text highlights the importance of adhering to the principle of least privilege, ensuring users are granted only the permissions they need to perform their tasks. This approach helps in minimizing security risks and controlling costs. The passage concludes by indicating that the next session will involve practical exercises in creating users and groups within IAM.

=== 4.2. IAM Users & Groups Hands On

The text provides a detailed walkthrough on creating IAM users in AWS. The steps include:

1. Accessing the IAM service in the AWS console.
2. Noting that IAM is a global service without a region selection.
3. The importance of creating IAM users instead of using the root user for better security.
4. Creating a user named "Stephane" and choosing to make an IAM user rather than using the identity center for simplicity and relevance to the exam.
5. Setting a custom password for the IAM user and deciding whether the user must change the password at next login.
6. Adding permissions to the user by creating a group named "admin" with administrator access policy and assigning the user to this group.
7. Reviewing the user creation steps and adding optional tags to resources, such as assigning a department to the user.
8. Completing the user creation process, with options to email sign-in instructions or download a CSV file of the user's credentials.
9. Exploring the user list and groups in the IAM dashboard, indicating that permissions can be efficiently managed through group membership.
10. Customizing the AWS account sign-in URL with an account alias for easier access.
11. Using a private browser window to log in with the new IAM user while keeping the root account logged in another window, showcasing how to operate two sessions simultaneously.
12. A reminder to securely manage root and admin user credentials to avoid account access issues.

The author emphasizes the significance of using IAM users over the root account for operational security, provides tips for managing user permissions through groups, and illustrates how to manage multiple AWS sessions. The guide is designed to help users understand and implement best practices in AWS account management and security.

=== 4.9. AWS CLI Setup on Mac OS X

The content outlines the steps for installing the AWS CLI version 2 on macOS. It involves downloading a .pkg file from the AWS website, using a graphical installer to install the CLI by following the on-screen prompts (continue, agree, install for all users, install), and then verifying the installation by opening a terminal application (such as the default Terminal or iTerm) and typing `aws --version` to check the installed version. The successful installation is confirmed by the terminal returning the version of the AWS CLI installed, in this case, AWS CLI 2.0.10. The guide suggests referring to additional documentation in case of issues during the installation process.

=== 4.12. AWS CloudShell

The lecture introduces AWS CloudShell as an alternative to using the terminal for issuing commands to AWS. CloudShell is a browser-based terminal available directly within the AWS console, offering a convenient way to manage AWS resources without needing to configure a local terminal. However, it's important to note that CloudShell is not available in all regions, so one should check the CloudShell availability in their preferred region first.

Key features and benefits of CloudShell mentioned include:

1. **Pre-installed AWS CLI:** CloudShell comes with the AWS CLI pre-installed, enabling users to execute AWS commands right away. The lecturer demonstrates checking the AWS CLI version to highlight this.

2. **Automatic Credential Handling:** When using CloudShell, AWS commands are executed with the credentials of the logged-in AWS account, simplifying API calls and credential management.

3. **Persistence of Files:** Files created in CloudShell, such as demonstration text files, are persistent across sessions, which means they won't disappear after logging out or restarting CloudShell.

4. **Customization and Usability Features:** Users can customize the CloudShell environment, including font size and theme. It also supports file upload and download, allowing for easy transfer of files between the local environment and CloudShell.

5. **Multiple Tabs:** CloudShell supports opening multiple tabs or splitting the view, enabling users to have several terminal sessions open simultaneously for more efficient work.

The lecturer emphasizes that CloudShell is a powerful tool for users who prefer a cloud-based terminal or need a quick way to manage AWS resources without configuring a local environment. However, it's also noted that using the traditional terminal is still a viable option for those who prefer it or cannot access CloudShell. The choice between using CloudShell or a local terminal depends on the user's preference, needs, and the availability of CloudShell in their region.

== 5. EC2 Fundamentals

=== 5.1. AWS Budget Setup

The speaker is providing a guide on how to manage and monitor costs for an AWS account, emphasizing the importance of setting up a budget and alerts to avoid overspending. Initially, they encounter an issue with accessing billing information due to being logged in as an IAM user, which they resolve by enabling IAM user and role access to billing information from the root account. They then explore the billing console, showcasing how to view detailed cost information, including month-to-date costs, forecasted costs, and historical bills. The speaker also highlights the utility of AWS's free tier and how to monitor usage against it.

To ensure spending does not exceed a certain threshold, they demonstrate how to set up two types of budgets: a zero spend budget that alerts at the first cent spent and a monthly cost budget with a predefined limit (e.g., $10), including email alerts at 85% and 100% spend thresholds, as well as when forecasted spend is expected to reach 100%. The speaker successfully receives an email alert for exceeding the zero spend budget, illustrating the functionality of the alert system.

The tutorial aims to equip viewers with the skills to effectively manage AWS costs, by leveraging budgets, the free tier, and detailed billing information to prevent unexpected charges.

=== 5.2. EC2 Basics

The content provides an introduction to Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), highlighting its significance as a core component of AWS (Amazon Web Services) for providing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). EC2 allows users to rent virtual machines (instances), store data on virtual drives (EBS volumes), distribute load using Elastic Load Balancer, and scale services through auto-scaling groups. The discussion also covers the customization options for EC2 instances, including the choice of operating systems (Linux, Windows, macOS), compute power, RAM, storage type (network-attached or hardware-attached), network specifications, and security settings through security groups. It introduces the concept of bootstrapping instances using EC2 User Data for automating tasks at launch, and emphasizes the importance of selecting the appropriate instance type based on the application's needs, showcasing examples ranging from t2.micro to more powerful instances like c5d.4xlarge. The t2.micro instance, as part of the AWS free tier offering, is highlighted for practical exercises in the course. The introduction promises hands-on learning to deepen understanding of EC2 and its role in cloud computing.

=== 5.3. Create an EC2 Instance with EC2 User Data to have a Website Hands On

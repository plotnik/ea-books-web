A key feature highlighted is RDS Storage Auto Scaling, which automatically increases storage based on usage, avoiding manual scaling operations. This feature is particularly useful for applications with unpredictable workloads and supports all RDS database engines.

=== 8.2. - RDS Read Replicas vs Multi AZ

This lecture is focused on explaining the differences between Amazon RDS Read Replicas and Multi-AZ deployments to prepare for an exam. It emphasizes the importance of understanding both concepts and their use cases.

**Read Replicas:**

- Designed to scale out the read operations of a database.
- Up to 15 Read Replicas can be created within the same availability zone, across availability zones, or across regions.
- They use asynchronous replication from the main database instance, leading to eventually consistent reads.
- Read Replicas can be promoted to become standalone databases.
- They are particularly useful for offloading read operations, like analytics and reporting, from the primary database to maintain performance.
- Networking costs for replication within the same region are typically waived, but cross-region replication incurs fees.

**Multi-AZ:**

- Primarily used for disaster recovery.
- Involves synchronous replication to a standby instance in a different availability zone.
- Offers high availability through automatic failover to the standby instance in case of issues with the primary.
- Not used for scaling; the standby instance cannot serve read or write operations until it is promoted during failover.
- Read Replicas can also be configured with Multi-AZ for added disaster recovery capability.

**Exam Tips:**

- Switching an RDS database from Single AZ to Multi-AZ is a zero-downtime operation that involves enabling Multi-AZ in the RDS settings. This process involves taking a snapshot of the primary database and restoring it to a new standby database, which then synchronizes with the primary to establish the Multi-AZ setup.

Understanding these concepts is crucial for making informed decisions about scaling and ensuring high availability and disaster recovery for Amazon RDS deployments.

=== 8.3. - Amazon RDS Hands On

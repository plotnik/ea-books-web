====

== 1. Setup

[arabic]
. *Configure Settings (optional)*
* Go to *File > Preferences > Settings* (Windows/Linux) or *Code >
Preferences > Settings* (macOS).
* Search for “Copilot” to see configuration options (e.g., inline
suggestions, enabling/disabling suggestions).

'''''

== 2. Basic Usage

[arabic]
. *Inline Suggestions*
* Start typing your code; Copilot will suggest completions inline
(semi-transparent text).
* Press *Tab* to accept the suggestion or keep typing to let Copilot
refine it.
. *Multi-line Suggestions*
* Type a descriptive comment or function signature.
* Copilot often generates multi-line code blocks following that comment.
* Accept with *Tab* or *Enter* (depending on your settings).
. *Ask Copilot in Comments*
* You can write a comment describing what you want, e.g.,
`+// Create a function that sums an array of numbers+`, and Copilot will
try to generate the solution below.
. *Trigger Suggestions Manually*
* Sometimes you need to re-trigger suggestions (especially if they
didn’t appear automatically).
* Use *Ctrl + Space* (Windows/Linux) or *Cmd + Space* (macOS) to open
IntelliSense suggestions (which can include Copilot suggestions).

== 3. Keyboard Shortcuts & Commands


NOTE: Some shortcuts may differ depending on your OS or personal
keybindings. Below are the most commonly used ones out of the box.

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Action |Windows/Linux |macOS
|*Accept* Copilot suggestion (inline) |`+Tab+` or `+Enter+` |`+Tab+` or
`+Enter+`

|*Show next* Copilot suggestion |`+Alt + ]+` |`+Option + ]+`

|*Show previous* Copilot suggestion |`+Alt + [+` |`+Option + [+`

|*Manually trigger* suggestions (IntelliSense) |`+Ctrl + Space+`
|`+Cmd + Space+`

|*Open Commands Palette* |`+Ctrl + Shift + P+` |`+Cmd + Shift + P+`
|===

=== Quick Commands via Command Palette

* *GitHub Copilot: Enable* _(turn on suggestions)_
* *GitHub Copilot: Disable* _(turn off suggestions)_
* *GitHub Copilot: Open Chat* _(for Chat Beta users)_

Just open the *Command Palette* and type “Copilot” to see these
commands.

== 4. Working with Suggestions

[arabic]
. *Reviewing Multiple Suggestions*
* If you see a suggestion inline but want to check more options, use
`+Alt + ]+` (Windows) / `+Option + ]+` (macOS) to cycle to the next
suggestion.
* Likewise, `+Alt + [+` (Windows) / `+Option + [+` (macOS) goes to the
previous suggestion.
. *Partial Acceptance*
* If only part of the suggestion is useful, you can accept it and then
edit the rest.
. *Context Matters*
* Copilot’s suggestions are heavily influenced by the surrounding code
and comments. Provide meaningful function names, comments, and
docstrings for better suggestions.

'''''

== 5. Tips & Best Practices

[arabic]
. *Use Comments for Clarity*
* The more descriptive your comment, the better Copilot can guess your
intentions.
* Example:
+
[source,js]
----
// Generate a React component that displays a user’s profile information
----
. *Check Security & Accuracy*
* Copilot is not always perfect. Always review generated code for
correctness, security issues, or licensing concerns.
. *Experiment with Different Prompts*
* Try short prompts for quick suggestions and longer, detailed prompts
for more complex tasks.
. *Leverage Snippets*
* Combine Copilot with your existing code snippets for a hybrid
approach.
. *Disable/Enable for Sensitive Code*
* If you’re working on sensitive or proprietary code, you can
temporarily disable Copilot to ensure no code suggestions are generated.

== 6. Common Use Cases

[arabic]
. *Rapid Prototyping*
* Outline functions or data structures quickly.
. *Boilerplate Code*
* Generate repetitive code (e.g., error-handling, common patterns).
. *Refactoring Assistance*
* Provide a comment for how you want to refactor; Copilot may suggest
partial or complete refactors.
. *Learning New APIs*
* Use Copilot suggestions to see example usage of libraries/APIs you’re
unfamiliar with.

'''''

== 7. Troubleshooting

[arabic]
. *Suggestions Not Appearing*
* Make sure you’re logged in to GitHub, and Copilot is enabled.
* Check your *User Settings* → *Copilot* is turned *On*.
* Ensure your environment (language server, network, etc.) is working
correctly.
. *Conflicts with IntelliSense*
* Sometimes VS Code’s IntelliSense might overshadow Copilot suggestions.
You can change the Copilot suggestion display setting in the extension
settings (e.g., inline vs. separate panel).
. *Rate Limits*
* GitHub Copilot has certain rate limits. If you exceed them,
suggestions might be delayed or missing temporarily.

=== Final Thoughts

GitHub Copilot in VS Code can supercharge your workflow by accelerating
code generation and reducing boilerplate. However, always review and
test the AI-generated code to ensure it meets your project’s
requirements and standards.

Happy coding with Copilot!

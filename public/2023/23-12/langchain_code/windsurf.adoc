== 💻   Prompts for lessons 7-10:

*📚   L7: Wikipedia Analysis App – Data Analysis*

Write a script that takes in a wikipedia category as a command line
argument and outputs the cumulative frequency of non-common words across
all of the pages in that category, and then run it on
"Large_language_models." Use the MediaWiki API.

*📚   L8: Wikipedia Analysis App – Caching*

[First prompt] Create a local cache of page results so that we aren't
rerunning the retrieval logic for the same category [Second prompt]
Create a local cache of the script's results so that we aren't rerunning
the processing logic for the same category

*📚   L9: Wikipedia Analysis App – Fullstack App*

Create a webpage that loads from the results cache (if available,
otherwise computes the frequencies from scratch) and displays a word
cloud where the sizes of the words are proportional to frequency. Use
HTML, javascript, and Flask. [Command] create a ColorPalette class that
would contain 6 hex colors, and a bunch of common color palettes that
extend the class

Integrate @get_all_color_palettes into the word cloud app. Make the
color palettes selectable in a drop down and display the colors being
used.

*📚   L10: Wikipedia Analysis App – Polish*

Add raw frequencies to the app as shown in the image.

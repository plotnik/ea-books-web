== 64. Module Introduction

You’ve learned the basics of building Angular apps using standalone components—the modern, recommended approach—but there’s an older alternative: Angular modules (NgModules). Introduced with Angular 2 in 2016, NgModules were the original way to group and organize components. Many existing projects still use them, so it’s important to understand how they work. In the next section you’ll learn:

• What an Angular module is and why it exists
• How to create a module and declare components in it
• How to export components from a module for reuse
• How to combine multiple modules and share functionality between them

== 65. A First Introduction To Angular Modules (NgModule)

Here’s a concise summary of the key points:

[arabic]
. Context
* You have an existing “essentials” Angular app built with Standalone
Components.
* You install dependencies (`+npm install+`) and start the app as
before.
. Why Angular Modules?
* Primarily a legacy feature, but still fully supported.
* You might choose modules if: +
• You’re maintaining an older project. +
• You prefer grouping via NgModules. +
• Your team is already module-oriented.
. Standalone vs. NgModules
* Standalone Components +
• Each component must list its template’s component/directive
dependencies in its own `+imports+` array.
* NgModules +
• You declare and export related components in a module’s
`+declarations+` and `+exports+`. +
• Components automatically see each other once they’re in the same
module—no per-component `+imports+` needed.
. Pros & Cons of NgModules
* Pros: +
• Leaner component decorators (no large `+imports+` on every component).
* Cons: +
• Harder to trace which components depend on which others. +
• Extra boilerplate (creating modules).
. Migration Plan
* Create one or more NgModules to bundle related components.
* Move component declarations and shared imports into those modules.
* Update the root bootstrap to use the new module instead of standalone.
* Optionally mix Standalone Components and NgModules if desired.
. Learning Outcome
* You’ll see firsthand how to define NgModules, declare and export
components, and understand how modules differ from Standalone
Components.

====
1. What exact command does the narrator run to install the application’s dependencies before starting the “essentials” project?  
2. When using Standalone Components, which three custom components does the AppComponent import for use in its template?  
3. According to this context, what is the primary historic reason for Angular modules, and what advantage do they offer over Standalone Components in terms of component decorator configuration?

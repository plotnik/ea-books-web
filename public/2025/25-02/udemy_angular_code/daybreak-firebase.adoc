Can you give me step-by step plan how can i create from scratch
Angular 20 app using standalone components
using material design and firebase
to show random poem from the list of poems stored in firebase.

In firebase i have "daybreak" collection with the following structure:

```
<daybreak>

<poem>
<id>1</id>
<text>
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
All mimsy were the borogoves,
And the mome raths outgrabe.

"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
The frumious Bandersnatch!"
</text>
</poem>

<poem>
<id>2</id>
<text>
He took his vorpal sword in hand:
Long time the manxome foe he soughtâ€”
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
And stood awhile in thought.

And as in uffish thought he stood,
The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
And burbled as it came!
</text>
</poem>

</daybreak>
```

Authorization rules in firebase are:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /daybreak/{document} {
      allow read: true;
    }
  }
}
```

Of course, here is a comprehensive, step-by-step plan to create an
Angular 20 application from scratch using standalone components, Angular
Material, and Firebase to display a random poem.

== *Part 1: Setting Up Your Angular Project*

This initial phase will focus on creating the foundational structure of
your Angular application.

=== *Step 1: Create a New Angular Application*

[arabic]
. *Open your terminal or command prompt.*
. *Navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.*
. *Run the following command to generate a new Angular project:*
+
```python
ng new --routing=false angular-poem-app
```
. *Follow the command-line prompts:*
* Choose your preferred stylesheet format (e.g., CSS, SCSS).
. *Navigate into your newly created project directory:*
+
```python
cd angular-poem-app
```

== *Part 2: Integrating Angular Material*

Now, you will add Angular Material to your project to leverage its
pre-built UI components for a polished look.

=== *Step 2: Add Angular Material*

[arabic]
. *In your project's root directory, run the following command:*
+
[source,bash]
----
ng add @angular/material
----
. *The CLI will prompt you with a few questions:*
* *Choose a prebuilt theme name, or "custom" for a custom theme:* Select
a theme that you like (e.g., `+Indigo/Pink+`).
* *Set up global Angular Material typography styles?* Choose *Yes*.
* *Include and enable animations?* Choose *Yes*.

This command will install Angular Material, the Component Dev Kit (CDK),
and Angular Animations, and will also configure your project to use
them.

== *Part 3: Setting Up Your Firebase Project*

This section covers the creation of your Firebase project and the
configuration of the Firestore database.

=== *Step 3: Create a Firebase Project*

[arabic]
. *Go to the https://console.firebase.google.com/[Firebase console].*
. *Click on "Add project".*
. *Enter a name for your project* (e.g., `+poem-app-project+`) and click
*Continue*.
. You can choose to enable Google Analytics or not for this project.
. *Click "Create project".*

=== *Step 4: Set Up Firestore and Add Data*

[arabic]
. From your Firebase project's dashboard, navigate to *Build > Firestore
Database*.
. *Click "Create database".*
. *Choose "Start in test mode"* and click *Next*. This allows for easy
reading and writing during development.
. *Select a Cloud Firestore location* that is geographically close to
you.
. *Click "Enable".*
. *Now, you will manually add your poem data:*
* Click on *"+ Start collection"*.
* For the *Collection ID*, enter `+daybreak+`.
* Click *"Next"*.
* For the first document, click on *"Auto-ID"* for the *Document ID*.
* Add two fields to this document:
** *Field:* `+id+`, *Type:* `+number+`, *Value:* `+1+`
** *Field:* `+text+`, *Type:* `+string+`, *Value:* Copy and paste the
first poem text.
* Click *"Save"*.
* Click *"+ Add document"* to add the second poem in the same
`+daybreak+` collection, following the same process with `+id+` 2 and
its corresponding text.

=== *Step 5: Configure Firebase Security Rules*

[arabic]
. In the Firestore Database section, go to the *"Rules"* tab.
. *Replace the existing rules with the following:*
+
....
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /daybreak/{document} {
      allow read: true;
      allow write: if false; // Disallow writing for security
    }
  }
}
....
. *Click "Publish"* to save your new rules.

== *Part 4: Connecting Angular to Firebase*

Here you will install the necessary library to communicate with Firebase
from your Angular app.

=== *Step 6: Install AngularFire*

[arabic]
. *In your terminal, within your Angular project's root directory, run:*
+
[source,bash]
----
ng add @angular/fire
----
. *The CLI will prompt you to select the Firebase features you want to
set up.* Use the spacebar to select *Firestore* and press Enter.
. The CLI will then prompt you to log in to your Firebase account and
select the Firebase project you created earlier.

This command will install the `+firebase+` and `+@angular/fire+`
packages and will also update your `+app.config.ts+` to initialize
Firebase.

== *Part 5: Building the Application Logic*

Now you will create the core components and services to fetch and
display the poems.

=== *Step 7: Create a Poem Service*

A service is the ideal place to handle your data interactions with
Firebase.

[arabic]
. *Generate a new service using the Angular CLI:*
+
[source,bash]
----
ng generate service services/poem
----
. *Open the newly created `+src/app/services/poem.service.ts+` file and
update it with the following code:*
+
[source,typescript]
----
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Firestore, collectionData, collection } from '@angular/fire/firestore';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

export interface Poem {
  id: number;
  text: string;
}

@Injectable({
  providedIn: 'root'
})
export class PoemService {

  constructor(private firestore: Firestore) { }

  getPoems(): Observable<Poem[]> {
    const poemsCollection = collection(this.firestore, 'daybreak');
    return collectionData(poemsCollection) as Observable<Poem[]>;
  }
}
----

=== *Step 8: Create the Poem Display Component*

This will be a standalone component responsible for showing a single,
randomly selected poem.

[arabic]
. *Generate a new standalone component:*
+
[source,bash]
----
ng generate component components/poem-display --standalone
----
. *Open `+src/app/components/poem-display/poem-display.component.ts+`
and update it:*
+
[source,typescript]
----
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
import { MatCardModule } from '@angular/material/card';
import { MatButtonModule } from '@angular/material/button';
import { Poem, PoemService } from '../../services/poem.service';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-poem-display',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [CommonModule, MatCardModule, MatButtonModule],
  templateUrl: './poem-display.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./poem-display.component.css']
})
export class PoemDisplayComponent implements OnInit {
  randomPoem$: Observable<Poem | undefined> | undefined;

  constructor(private poemService: PoemService) {}

  ngOnInit(): void {
    this.getRandomPoem();
  }

  getRandomPoem(): void {
    this.randomPoem$ = this.poemService.getPoems().pipe(
      map(poems => {
        if (poems && poems.length > 0) {
          const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * poems.length);
          return poems[randomIndex];
        }
        return undefined;
      })
    );
  }
}
----
. *Now, update the template in
`+src/app/components/poem-display/poem-display.component.html+`:*
+
[source,ng2]
----
<div *ngIf="randomPoem$ | async as poem; else loading">
  <mat-card>
    <mat-card-header>
      <mat-card-title>A Random Poem</mat-card-title>
    </mat-card-header>
    <mat-card-content>
      <pre>{{ poem.text }}</pre>
    </mat-card-content>
    <mat-card-actions>
      <button mat-raised-button color="primary" (click)="getRandomPoem()">Show Another Poem</button>
    </mat-card-actions>
  </mat-card>
</div>

<ng-template #loading>
  <p>Loading poems...</p>
</ng-template>
----
* The `+<pre>+` tag is used to preserve the whitespace and line breaks
in the poem's text.

== *Part 6: Bringing It All Together*

Finally, you will integrate your new component into the main application
component.

=== *Step 9: Update the Main App Component*

[arabic]
. *Open `+src/app/app.component.ts+` and modify it to include your
`+PoemDisplayComponent+`:*
+
[source,typescript]
----
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';
import { PoemDisplayComponent } from './components/poem-display/poem-display.component';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  standalone: true,
  imports: [RouterOutlet, PoemDisplayComponent],
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'angular-poem-app';
}
----
. *Open `+src/app/app.component.html+` and replace its content with the
following:*
+
[source,html]
----
<main>
  <h1>Welcome to the Random Poem Generator!</h1>
  <app-poem-display></app-poem-display>
</main>
----

== *Part 7: Run Your Application*

You are now ready to see your application in action.

=== *Step 10: Serve the Application*

[arabic]
. *In your terminal, make sure you are in the root directory of your
project and run:*
+
[source,bash]
----
ng serve
----
. *Open your web browser and navigate to `+http://localhost:4200/+`.*

You should now see your Angular application displaying a random poem
from your Firebase Firestore database, styled with Angular Material. You
can click the "Show Another Poem" button to fetch and display another
random poem.

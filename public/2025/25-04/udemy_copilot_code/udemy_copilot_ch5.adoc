== Planning the Application Structure with ChatGPT

[NOTE]
====
The user plans to build a REST API using Node and Express that allows authenticated users to create, share, and register/unregister for events. They want to leverage AI (specifically ChatGPT) initially to help plan the application structure and core features without generating code yet. The AI provides helpful suggestions including:

- A possible project structure with folders like controllers and models (though the user will customize it, e.g., placing uploads in a public folder).
- Using JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
- A user model with username, email, and hashed password fields (using bcrypt).
- Event model fields: title, description, date, location, plus a creator/user ID to link events to users.
- Suggested API endpoints for user authentication, event management, and event registration.
- Additional helpful routes like fetching all registrations for a specific event.
- Using `multer` library for image uploads.
- Suggested files and code organization, which the user will adapt.
- Database management suggestions (like Mongoose or SQLite) which the user will not follow, opting for a different approach.

Overall, the AI helps confirm and expand the user's initial requirements and provides a solid planning foundation. The user will next move to using AI-assisted coding tools like Cursor and GitHub Copilot to build the actual application code based on this plan.
====

[arabic]
. Project Overview +
• Build a REST API with Node.js & Express +
• Core features: +
– User authentication (register, login) +
– CRUD for events (title, description, date, location, image) +
– Event registration/unregistration +
– Image uploads
. Why Use ChatGPT for Planning? +
• Capture missing requirements early +
• Get concrete suggestions for architecture, models, and routes +
• Validate best practices (e.g. password hashing, token‐based auth) +
• Stay in control—accept, tweak, or ignore any suggestion
. Prompt Structure +
Role assigned: _“You’re my technical architect.”_ +
Requirements summary: +
– _REST API in Node.js/Express_ +
– _JWT authentication + bcrypt for passwords_ +
– _Event model fields + image upload_ +
– _Registration endpoints_ +
Instruction: _“Don’t generate code now—just outline building blocks & project structure.”_
. Key AI-Generated Suggestions +
A. Project Structure 
+
```bash
• src/ 
    – controllers/ 
    – models/ 
    – routes/ 
    – middleware/ 
    – config/ 
• public/uploads/ (for images) 
• server.js, .env, package.json 
```
+
B. Authentication +
• JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless sessions +
• `bcrypt` to hash passwords +
C. Data Models
[arabic]
.. User: `{ username, email, passwordHash }`
.. Event: `{ title, description, date, location, imagePath, creatorId }`
.. Registration: `{ userId, eventId, registeredAt }` +
D. Endpoints 
+
```
• POST /auth/register, /auth/login
• GET /users/me 
• GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /events 
• POST /events/:id/register, DELETE /events/:id/unregister 
• GET /events/:id/registrations 
```
+
E. Middleware & Utilities +
• authMiddleware (verify JWT) +
• errorHandler +
• uploadMiddleware (e.g. multer)
. Customizations & Decisions +
• Move uploads folder to public directory (not under src/) +
• Skip Mongoose/SQLite—choose preferred ORM or database +
• Adapt folder names and granularities to team conventions
. Next Steps
[arabic]
.. Switch to Cursor (or your IDE)
.. Scaffold files and folders per agreed structure
.. Use GitHub Copilot or AI tools to generate and refine code
.. Iteratively test auth flows, CRUD operations, and file uploads

With this plan in hand, you’ll hit the ground running—no surprises, no
forgotten endpoints, and a clear roadmap for implementation.

[CAUTION]
====
1. What specific project structure and folder organization did the AI suggest for building a Node and Express REST API with user authentication and event management, and which parts did the user decide to modify or reject?

2. How did the AI help identify missing elements or routes in the initial event management requirements, such as linking events to users or adding a route to fetch all registrations for a specific event?

3. Which libraries and security practices did the AI recommend for password hashing, image uploads, and authentication, and how did these suggestions align with or differ from the user's initial plans?
====


== Setting Up the Project in Cursor AI

[NOTE]
====
The user is setting up a new Node.js REST API project using Cursor in an empty folder. They start by creating a package.json file with `npm init -y`, then manually edit it to set the main entry file to `app.js`, add their name and company, specify `"type": "module"` for ES module support, and add a dev script using Node.js's built-in watch mode instead of nodemon. They create a `.env` file for environment variables like JWT secrets and a `.gitignore` file to exclude `.env`, `node_modules`, and Mac-specific files. They install Express.js as the main dependency for building the API. The user organizes the project structure by adding root-level folders: `controllers`, `models`, `routes`, and a `public/images` folder for uploads. Up to this point, all setup is manual since the user knows what they want, but next they plan to use Cursor's AI features to generate code and files to build out the API.
====


[arabic]
. Create a new project folder 
+
```bash
mkdir my-rest-api 
cd my-rest-api
```
. Initialize npm
+
```bash
npm init -y
```
+
This generates a basic package.json.
. Edit package.json +
• Set “name”, “author” (your name/company) +
• Change `+"main"+` to `+"app.js"+` +
• Add `+"type": "module"+` to enable ES module syntax +
• Under `+"scripts"+`, replace `+"test"+` with:
+
[source,json]
----
"dev": "node --watch app.js"
----
+
This uses Node’s built-in watch mode so your server restarts on file
changes.
. Create a .env file +
Store secrets or configuration there, e.g.:
+
[source,dotenv]
----
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
PORT=3000
----
. Create a .gitignore
+
[source,gitignore]
----
node_modules/
.env
.DS_Store
----
. Install Express
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install express
----
. Create your entry point: app.js +
In app.js, start with a minimal Express server:
+
[source,js]
----
import express from 'express';
import dotenv from 'dotenv';

dotenv.config();

const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.use(express.json());

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, world!');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
----
. Scaffold your folder structure +
At the project root, create these directories: • controllers/ +
• models/ +
• routes/ +
• public/images/
+
You’ll place route definitions in routes/, business logic in
controllers/, data schemas or ORM models in models/, and any static
assets (like uploaded images) in public/.
. Next steps with AI tooling (optional) +
Now that the foundation is laid, you can leverage tools like Cursor or
ChatGPT to generate boilerplate code inside your
controllers/models/routes folders—saving you from writing every endpoint
by hand.
. Run your server
+
[source,bash]
----
npm run dev
----
+
Visit http://localhost:3000 to verify it’s up and running.

From here, gradually add your resource routes (e.g. users, products),
connect to a database, and flesh out controllers and models. This
structure keeps your code organized and makes collaboration much
smoother.

[CAUTION]
====
1. What specific folder structure and file setup does the author prefer for their Node.js REST API project, and how does it differ from the example suggested by the AI?

2. How does the author configure the package.json file differently from the default npm init output, particularly regarding the main entry file, module type, and development scripts?

3. Which files and folders does the author decide to create manually before using AI assistance, and what rationale do they provide for these choices?
====

== Writing User Registration & Login Code with Cursor Composer

[NOTE]
====
The user is working on building an application with multiple requirements and is using ChatGPT and CursorComposer to generate code and files. They emphasize breaking down the app development into smaller steps rather than one big prompt to improve results. The first step tackled is user registration and login, focusing on generating a user model (without classes or OOP), sign-up and login routes, and linking routes to controllers. They requested no JWT or database code yet. CursorComposer generated a `user.js` model with an object containing two methods (though the user prefers separate functions), routes for sign-up and login pointing to controller functions, and integration of these routes in `app.js` with JSON body parser middleware. Overall, the generated structure looks reasonable but the user has some reservations about certain suggestions and wants to refine the code further.
====

=== 1. Context & Strategy

I’m building a REST API and want to tackle it in small, manageable
chunks. +
My first slice is *user registration & login*. Rather than dumping the
entire app spec into one prompt, I’ll:

[arabic]
. Define exactly what I need for authentication (no JWT/database yet).
. Split that into a clear, targeted prompt for CursorComposer.
. Review the generated files and refine as needed.

'''''

=== 2. First Prompt to CursorComposer

[source,text]
----
This REST API needs user authentication.  
Users must be able to register (sign up) and log in.  

Requirements:
- No JWT or database code yet—just the model, routes, and controller stubs.  
- Use plain functions (not classes).  
- Place files under:  
  • models/user.js  
  • controllers/userController.js  
  • routes/users.js  

- In models/user.js, export two separate functions: createUser(data) and authenticateUser(data).  
- In routes/users.js, set up:  
  • POST /users/signup → calls createUser  
  • POST /users/login  → calls authenticateUser  

- In controllers/userController.js, export matching functions.  
- Wire up the routes in app.js under the “/users” prefix.  
- Include Express’s JSON body-parser middleware.

Don’t add database persistence code yet; we’ll handle that in a later step.
----

'''''

=== 3. Generated Output (Summary)

CursorComposer gave me:

• `models/user.js` +
   Exports a single object with two methods (I wanted two functions instead). 
• `routes/users.js` +
   Defines `+/signup+` and `+/login+` routes correctly. 
• `controllers/userController.js` +
  Exports an object mirroring `models/user`. +
• `app.js` +
  Imports `+express.json()+` +
  Mounts `+routes/users.js+` at `+/users+`

Overall—good structure and folder layout, plus body-parser middleware.

'''''

=== 4. What I’d Tweak Next

[arabic]
. *Separate Functions* +
`models/user.js` → export `+createUser()+` and `+authenticateUser()+`
instead of one object.
. *Consistent Naming* +
Align function names between models, controllers, and routes.
. *Folder Paths* +
Confirm controllers go into `+/controllers+` (not “controller’s” or
“controllers folder”).
. *Error Handling Stub* +
Add basic `+try/catch+` blocks and `+res.status()+` calls in
controllers.

'''''

=== 5. Next Prompt Refinement

[source,text]
----
Please update the files you generated to:

1. In `models/user.js`:
   • Export two named functions:  
     - async function createUser({ email, password })  
     - async function authenticateUser({ email, password })
   • Do not wrap them in an object—use separate exports.

2. In `controllers/userController.js`:
   • Import the two functions by name.
   • Add try/catch around each call, sending 200 or 400 with JSON messages.

3. Ensure routes/users.js uses:
   • `const { createUser, authenticateUser } = require('../models/user');`
   • `const { signup, login } = require('../controllers/userController');`
   • `router.post('/signup', signup);`
   • `router.post('/login', login);`

4. No database code yet—just stub responses.
----

That gives CursorComposer a precise second pass to align everything
exactly how I need it.

[CAUTION]
====
1. How does the generated user model structure differ from the desired approach of having separate functions instead of an object with methods, and what specific changes would be needed to align it with the user's preference?

2. What is the exact folder and file organization pattern used by CursorComposer for the user authentication feature, including the placement of models, routes, and controllers, and how does this structure facilitate linking routes to controllers?

3. How does the generated Express `app.js` file integrate the user routes and middleware, specifically the JSON body parser, and what are the implications of this setup for handling incoming user registration and login requests before database integration?
====

== Providing Follow-Up Feedback To Cursor Composer

[NOTE]
====
The user describes their preferences and workflow for organizing JavaScript code, focusing on two main points: 

1. They prefer exporting and importing standalone functions rather than methods inside objects or classes. They want simple, plain functions exported individually across all files.

2. They want to use the modern ECMAScript Module (ESM) syntax for imports and exports instead of the older CommonJS style.

They provide feedback to an AI coding assistant (Cursor) to adjust the code accordingly. Cursor updates the code to have standalone functions like createUser and findUserByEmail, and switches all import/export statements to ESM syntax. The user accepts these changes, rejects unnecessary ones (like redundant package.json or gitignore edits), and manually renames files to their preferred naming convention.

Additionally, the user prefers defining functions with the traditional `function` keyword rather than arrow functions assigned to constants. Cursor helps convert arrow functions to this style with export keywords, speeding up the process by suggesting similar changes for multiple functions.

Overall, the user achieves a clean, modular codebase with standalone exported functions using modern ESM syntax and traditional function declarations, setting a solid foundation for further development of user registration features with AI assistance.
====

[arabic]
. Goals
* Keep everything as standalone functions rather than methods on
objects.
* Switch from CommonJS (`+require+`/`+module.exports+`) to modern ESM
(`+import+`/`+export+`).
. Iteration with the AI assistant (Cursor) +
• First feedback: _“Don’t wrap methods in objects—export independent functions in every file.”_ +
• Result:
* `+createUser(data)+` and `+findUserByEmail(email)+` appeared as
top-level functions.
* No database logic was added yet, per earlier instructions. +
• Second feedback: _“Convert all import/export statements to ESM syntax.”_ +
• Result:
* `+export function …+` and `+import { … } from '…'+` replaced CommonJS.
* Cursor added `+type: "module"+` in `+package.json+` (which I’d already
set), and tweaked `+.gitignore+`.
. Accepting/rejecting changes
* Accepted updates to `+user.js+`, `+users.js+`, and
`+users.controller.js+`.
* Rejected the redundant `+package.json+` change.
* Accepted the minor `+.gitignore+` tweak.
. Manual refinements
* Renamed files to match my preferred naming convention.
* Converted arrow functions to named function declarations for clarity:
+
[source,js]
----
// Before
export const createUser = (data) => { … }
// After
export function createUser(data) { … }
----
* Cursor’s autocompletion spotted the pattern and quickly applied the
same transform to `+findUserByEmail()+` and the controller functions.

Outcome: a clean, ESM-based codebase composed of plain, exported
functions—ready for the next development steps.

[CAUTION]
====
1. How does the author prefer to structure and export functions in their Node.js project, and what specific syntax changes do they make to achieve this?

2. What role does the AI tool "Cursor" play in refactoring the code, and how does it assist with converting arrow functions to traditional function declarations with exports?

3. Why does the author reject certain automated changes suggested by the AI (e.g., changes to `package.json` or `.gitignore`), and what does this reveal about their workflow preferences?
====

== Connecting to A SQLite Database with Cursor's Sidebar Chat

[NOTE]
====
The user is enhancing a Node.js Express REST API by integrating a SQLite database to store user data. They use an AI chat tool within their code editor (Cursor) to help generate code for database setup, including creating a database.js file to initialize the database and update user-related model functions to interact with the database. Initially, the AI suggests using the `sqlite3` package, but the user prefers the `better-sqlite3` package for improved performance and requests updated instructions accordingly.

The user encounters some workflow issues with applying AI-generated code snippets directly to the correct files, so they manually create the `database.js` file and then apply the changes. They review and tweak the generated code, such as removing unnecessary "auto increment" from the table schema for better performance. The user updates the `user.js` model to import the database functions and implement user creation and lookup by email using the database. Finally, they modify `app.js` to import and call the database initialization function, ensuring the server shuts down if initialization fails.

Overall, the process involves using AI-assisted code generation combined with manual adjustments and testing to integrate a SQLite database into the existing Node Express application for persistent user data storage.
====

====
Prompts:

> i want to store data in sqlite database. how would i add one to the application?

> i want to use better-sqlite3 package. update you response accordingly
====

Here’s a much tighter, step-by-step guide for swapping your in-memory
user store out for a SQLite database using the `better-sqlite3` package in
a Node/Express REST API.

Prerequisites +
• You already have an Express app (app.js) and a basic
`+models/user.js+`. +
• Routes exist to “create user” and “find user by email.”

Goal +
Persist user data in SQLite instead of keeping it in memory.

'''''

[arabic]
. Install better-sqlite3
+
[source,bash]
----
npm install better-sqlite3
----
. Create a database module +
Next to `+app.js+`, add `+database.js+`:
+
[source,js]
----
// database.js
const Database = require('better-sqlite3');
let db;

function initializeDatabase(filePath = './data.db') {
  db = new Database(filePath);
  db.exec(`
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
      id       INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
      email    TEXT UNIQUE    NOT NULL,
      password TEXT           NOT NULL
    );
  `);
  return db;
}

function getDatabase() {
  if (!db) throw new Error('Database not initialized');
  return db;
}

module.exports = { initializeDatabase, getDatabase };
----
. Update your user model +
In `+models/user.js+`, replace whatever you had with:
+
[source,js]
----
// models/user.js
const { getDatabase } = require('../database');

function createUser({ email, password }) {
  const db   = getDatabase();
  const stmt = db.prepare('INSERT INTO users (email, password) VALUES (?, ?)');
  const info = stmt.run(email, password);
  return { id: info.lastInsertRowid, email, password };
}

function findUserByEmail(email) {
  const db   = getDatabase();
  const stmt = db.prepare('SELECT id, email, password FROM users WHERE email = ?');
  return stmt.get(email);
}

module.exports = { createUser, findUserByEmail };
----
. Wire up the database in your app entrypoint +
In `+app.js+`, import and initialize before registering routes:
+
[source,js]
----
// app.js
const express = require('express');
const { initializeDatabase } = require('./database');

const app = express();

try {
  initializeDatabase('./data.db');
  console.log('✅ SQLite database initialized');
} catch (err) {
  console.error('❌ Failed to initialize database:', err);
  process.exit(1);
}

app.use(express.json());
// require('./routes/users')(app)  – your user routes here

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;
app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
----
. Test it +
• Start your server. +
• POST to `+/users+` with `+{ "email": "...", "password": "..." }+`. +
• Verify `+data.db+` contains your new user (e.g. via
`+sqlite3 data.db "SELECT * FROM users;"+`).

That’s it! You now have a persistent SQLite store backing your
user-creation endpoints, all via better-sqlite3.

====
Sign up a new user:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/users/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "password123"}'
```

---
Login with the created user:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/users/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "password123"}'
```
==== 

[CAUTION]
====
1. How does the integration of the `better-sqlite3` package differ from the `sqlite3` package in terms of initialization and usage within this specific Node Express REST API project?

2. What is the recommended workflow for applying code changes using the integrated chat in Cursor when adding new files (like `database.js`) versus updating existing files (like `user.js`), and what limitations were encountered?

3. Why was the `auto increment` attribute removed from the SQLite table creation code in this project, and what are the implications of this decision on database performance and ID generation?
====

== Tweaking AI-Generated Code

[NOTE]
====
The user explains improvements made to their `app.js` code: instead of exporting the app object directly, they now start the server with app.listen and initialize the database inside the listen callback. This ensures the database only initializes if the server starts successfully. They also modify the port configuration to use an environment variable (PORT) with a fallback to 3000, making the app more flexible. The updated `app.js` handles requests to `/users` by routing them to user routes, which invoke controller functions that interact with the user model to perform database operations like creating users. Overall, the changes improve server startup flow and configuration.
====

Here’s a more concise, structured explanation of what we’re doing in
`app.js`:

[arabic]
. Start the server before initializing the database +
• Instead of exporting the Express app and initializing the DB
immediately, call `+app.listen(...)+` right away. +
• In the listen callback (i.e. once the server has successfully
started), run your database‐initialization logic. +
• If the server fails to start, the callback never fires, so you never
attempt to initialize the database.
. Use a configurable port +
• Read the port from `+process.env.PORT+` when available, otherwise fall
back to `+3000+`. +
• This lets you adapt to hosting environments that assign dynamic ports.
+
[source,js]
----
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
----
. Full flow in `app.js` +
• Configure middleware and routes first (e.g.
`+app.use('/users', userRoutes)+`). +
• Call `+app.listen(port, async (err) => { … })+`. +
– Inside this callback, initialize the database. +
– On failure, log the error and exit the process. +
– On success, log “Server is running on port X”.
. Routing and controllers +
• All requests to `+/users+` go to your `userRoutes` module. +
• Each route handler calls the appropriate function in `userController.js`. +
• Controllers in turn use `userModel.js` to interact with the database
(e.g. inserting a new user).

By structuring it this way: 

• We only initialize the DB once the server is confirmed up. +
• We support configurable ports out of the box. +
• Our *route → controller → model* flow stays clean and predictable.

[CAUTION]
====
1. Why does the code initialize the database inside the callback of `app.listen` instead of before starting the server?

2. How does the updated port selection logic in `app.js` determine which port the server listens on?

3. What is the sequence of function calls and file interactions when handling requests to the `/users` route in this application?
====

== Using Inline Chat For Editing Validation Code

[NOTE]
====
The application is progressing steadily, with a focus on improving user data validation during account creation. Instead of blindly accepting input, the developer wants to ensure the email is valid, unique in the database, and the password meets a minimum length (at least six characters) and is not just blank spaces. They use inline AI-assisted code editing to enhance the validation logic in the user controller, adding checks for trimmed input, regex-based email validation, password length, and duplicate email detection. While AI helped generate this improved validation, the developer notes that sometimes manual coding might be faster and cautions against over-reliance on AI. They also plan lighter validation for login inputs and acknowledge that currently passwords are stored in plain text, which will be addressed later. Overall, this is an iterative step toward a more robust and secure user signup process.
====

Here’s a more polished, step-by-step summary of how we improved our
user-creation and login flows with proper validation:

[arabic]
. Identify Where to Validate +
• Instead of lumping everything into the low-level utility function, we
chose the UsersController’s `+createUser+` (signup) method—where request
data is first extracted—as the right place to validate. +
• For login, we only need minimal checks (to avoid blank inputs) since
credentials get verified later.
. Define Our Validation Rules +
• Email +
– Must not be empty or just whitespace (hence `+.trim()+`). +
– Must match a standard email-format regex. +
– Must be unique in the database (no existing user with that email). +
• Password +
– Must not be empty or just whitespace. +
– Must be at least six characters long.
. Use Inline AI-Powered Editing +
• We highlighted the entire signup method. +
• We invoked our editor’s inline chat (Cursor) and told it: “Add robust
email and password validation per the rules above.” +
• The AI inserted: +
– `+const email = req.body.email?.trim()+` and
`+const password = req.body.password?.trim()+` +
– Checks for empty strings after trimming. +
– A regex test for valid email format, returning a 400 error if it
fails. +
– `+User.findOne({ email })+` to enforce uniqueness, returning a 409 if
already taken. +
– A length check on the password, returning a 400 if it’s under six
characters.
. Tweak the Login Endpoint +
• For `+/login+`, we similarly ensure `+email.trim()+` and
`+password.trim()+` aren’t empty. +
• We skip stricter checks here, trusting the authentication routine to
handle format and credential validation.
. Next Steps +
• We’re still storing passwords in plain text—for now. +
• Our immediate goal is to get these validations in place and test the
flow. +
• After confirming that requests are properly vetted, we’ll add hashing
(e.g., with bcrypt) and any additional safeguards.

Key Takeaways

• Inline AI-assistant tools can speed up repetitive editing tasks
(regex, trimming boilerplate, etc.). +
• Don’t let AI make every decision for you—stay in the driver’s seat. +
• Always validate at the boundary (where external input enters your
system).

== Testing the REST API With Postman

[NOTE]
====
The content explains how to test a REST API during development using the `npm run dev` command to start the server and Postman as a tool to send requests. Specifically, it demonstrates sending a POST request to the `/users/signup` endpoint with JSON data containing an email and password. The server responds with a success message and user details, which are stored in a SQLite database file. However, the password is stored in plain text, which is a security risk. The author notes the need to fix this by hashing the password before storage, as storing unencrypted passwords can lead to serious vulnerabilities if the database is compromised. They mention that while Cursor suggested code that hashes passwords, their current setup does not, so they plan to update it accordingly.
====

Here’s a cleaned-up, step-by-step guide for running your server, testing
the signup endpoint with Postman, and spotting the plain-text password
issue:

[arabic]
. Start the Development Server +
• In your project folder run: +
`+npm run dev+` +
• This launches your Express app on http://localhost:3000.
. Install & Launch Postman +
• Download the free Postman desktop app (no account required to test
APIs). +
• Open Postman and click “New Request.”
. Configure the Signup Request +
• Method: POST +
• URL: http://localhost:3000/users/signup +
• Body: +
– Select “raw” +
– Choose “JSON” +
– Enter a JSON object, for example: +
`+json { "email": "test@example.com", "password": "test123abc" } +`
. Send & Verify the Response +
• Click “Send.” +
• You should receive a 200 OK (or 201 Created) with a message like: +
`+{"message":"User created successfully","user":{"id":1,"email":"test@example.com"}}+`
. Inspect the SQLite Database +
• A file named `+database.sqlite+` appears in your project root. +
• To view its contents, install a SQLite viewer (e.g. VS Code’s SQLite
extension). +
• Confirm that the `+users+` table contains your new record.
. Security Warning: Plain-Text Passwords +
• Right now, passwords are stored unhashed in the database. +
• If an attacker ever accessed your database file, they’d see every
user’s password. +
• Always hash passwords before saving—e.g., using bcrypt—so stored
passwords can’t be read directly.

Next Steps +
• Update your signup handler to hash `+req.body.password+` before
inserting into SQLite. +
• Re-run your tests to confirm passwords are now stored safely as
encrypted hashes.

== Encrypting User Passwords With bcryptjs

[NOTE]
====
The user is updating their application to securely handle passwords by hashing them before storage using the bcrypt.js package. They manually install bcrypt.js, then modify the code to hash passwords asynchronously before saving them. They add a new function to verify user credentials by comparing a plaintext password with the stored hashed password. This verification function is integrated into the login controller, which is updated to handle asynchronous calls and return appropriate success or error responses.

After implementing these changes, they clear the existing database to remove plaintext passwords and restart the server. Testing signup confirms that passwords are now stored as hashes. However, they encounter two issues: the signup response returns an empty object instead of user data, and login attempts produce errors. These problems are identified for further debugging and fixing in subsequent steps.
====

Here’s a cleaner, more structured write-up of what you did—and why—when
integrating bcrypt.js for password hashing and verification:

[arabic]
. Install the bcrypt.js package +
Run in your project root: +
`+npm install bcryptjs+` +
(We prefer bcryptjs over the native bcrypt module because it’s simpler
to install and use in this application.)
. Update the User model to hash passwords +
• Import bcryptjs at the top of your user model file: +
`+const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');+` +
• Replace your existing “store password in plain text” logic with an
async `+hashPassword+` helper:
+
[source,js]
----
// before saving a new user…
async function hashPassword(plainPassword) {
  const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(12);
  return await bcrypt.hash(plainPassword, salt);
}

// e.g. in your createUser function
async function createUser(data) {
  const hashed = await hashPassword(data.password);
  // store `hashed` instead of data.password
  …
}
----
+
• Mark your model functions with `+async+` where you call bcrypt’s async
methods.
. Add a verify-credentials helper +
In the same model file, export a new function that: +
• Accepts `+email+` and `+plainPassword+`. +
• Queries the database for a user by email. +
• If no user is found, returns `+null+`. +
• Otherwise, uses `+bcrypt.compare(plainPassword, user.passwordHash)+`
to check the password. +
• Returns a simplified user object (`+{ id, email }+`) on success, or
`+null+` if the password doesn’t match.
+
[source,js]
----
async function verifyUserCredentials(email, plainPassword) {
  const user = await db('users').where({ email }).first();
  if (!user) return null;

  const isValid = await bcrypt.compare(plainPassword, user.passwordHash);
  return isValid ? { id: user.id, email: user.email } : null;
}

module.exports = { createUser, verifyUserCredentials, … };
----
. Wire up the login controller +
In your users controller’s `+login+` handler: +
• Mark it `+async+`. +
• Call `+verifyUserCredentials(email, password)+`. +
• If the helper returns `+null+`, respond with a 401 Unauthorized. +
• Otherwise, respond with 200 OK and the user data. +
• Catch any unexpected errors and return a 500.
+
[source,js]
----
async function login(req, res) {
  try {
    const { email, password } = req.body;
    const user = await verifyUserCredentials(email, password);

    if (!user) {
      return res.status(401).json({ error: 'Invalid credentials.' });
    }

    res.json({ message: 'Login successful', user });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    res.status(500).json({ error: 'Server error.' });
  }
}
----
. Test end to end +
• Delete your SQLite file to wipe out any plain-text passwords. +
• Restart your server (`+npm run dev+`). +
• Send a signup request → verify the database now stores a bcrypt
hash. +
• Send a login request → you should get back
`+{ message: 'Login successful', user: { id, email } }+`. +
• If you see an empty object or errors, dig into your return values and
JSON serialization to make sure you’re returning the expected fields.

Next steps: fix the bug where signup returns an empty object instead of
the new user data, and ensure your login route handles all edge cases.

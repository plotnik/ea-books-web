== Chapter 2: Leverage GitHub Copilot Suggestions & Chat

In this chapter, we explore how to write, refactor, and manage code efficiently using GitHub Copilot’s inline suggestions, chat interfaces, slash commands, and multi-file edits. You’ll learn best practices for prompting, configuring Copilot, and integrating it into your daily workflow.

=== 2.1 Using AI-Powered Code Suggestions

GitHub Copilot provides real-time, context-aware suggestions as you type.

==== 2.1.1 Basic Usage in VS Code

1. Install and sign in to the GitHub Copilot extension.
2. Open a file (e.g., Python).
3. Start typing a function signature:
+
[source,python]
----
def fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
   |
----
4. Copilot will display an inline suggestion. Press `Tab` to accept it.

==== 2.1.2 Key Takeaways

- Suggestion Variability
  Copilot’s output can change over time or between users. Be explicit in your code comments or function names to guide it.

- Multiple Suggestions
  • Pause after typing to trigger alternate completions.
  • Open the Completions Panel (⇧⌥I) to browse options.

- Accepting Suggestions
  • `Tab` accepts the full suggestion.
  • Use word-by-word acceptance (e.g., `Ctrl`+`]` on Windows/Linux).

TIP: If you miss a suggestion, move the cursor up one line and back down to retrigger Copilot.

=== 2.2 “Next Edit Suggestions”

Copilot’s *Next Edit Suggestions* predicts your next change.

1. In VS Code settings, search “GitHub Copilot” → enable **Next Edit Suggestions**.
2. Rename a variable (e.g., `F` → `Fahrenheit`).
3. Copilot suggests renaming other occurrences—accept with `Tab` or reject with `Esc`.

TIP: Use this for bulk refactorings without manual search-and-replace.

=== 2.3 Mastering Prompts: Using Comments as AI Prompts

Instead of choosing perfect function names, write clear comments:

[source,python]
----
# Function that takes either a Celsius or Fahrenheit temperature
# and converts it to the other scale.
----
Copilot reads the comment and generates the function body.

Key tips:

- Treat comments as prompts—describe *what* you want in plain English.
- Use the Completions Panel (⇧⌥I) for more suggestions.
- Place prompt comments anywhere: top-of-file, inside functions, etc.

=== 2.4 Building a Full Python Backup Script

We’ll combine Copilot’s suggestions and manual edits to create a CLI tool that backs up and restores an SQLite database.

==== 2.4.1 Setup Variables

[source,python]
----
import shutil

DB_FILE = "app.db"
BACKUP_FILE = "backup.db"
----

Copilot suggests `BACKUP_FILE`, rename to your preference.

==== 2.4.2 Generating Functions

- `backup_database()`
- `restore_database()`

Copilot also adds `import shutil` if needed.

==== 2.4.3 Implementing Main Logic

Copilot’s initial suggestion may not match your flow. Manually scaffold:

[source,python]
----
def main():
    print("1) Backup database")
    print("2) Restore database")
    print("3) Exit")
    choice = input("Select an option: ")
    if choice == "1":
        backup_database()
    elif choice == "2":
        restore_database()
    else:
        print("Goodbye!")
----

Add `if __name__ == "__main__": main()` manually if Copilot does not suggest it.

==== 2.4.4 Key Takeaways

- Copilot excels at boilerplate code and imports.
- Always review and adapt generated code.
- For higher-level logic, you may need to write manually.

=== 2.5 Using the Inline Chat for Error Handling

Copilot Chat in VS Code lets you ask for specific edits on selected code.

==== 2.5.1 Opening Inline Chat

- Mac: ⇧⌘I
- Windows/Linux: Ctrl+I

==== 2.5.2 Adding Error Handling

1. Select the code block.
2. Invoke Inline Chat → type “Add error handling around backup_database”.
3. Copilot shows a diff:
   - Dark green = unchanged
   - Light green = additions
   - Red = removals
4. Accept or discard the changes.

TIP: You can attach screenshots or use voice prompts if configured.

=== 2.6 Configuring GitHub Copilot

Customize Copilot’s behavior in VS Code:

- **Enable/Disable by Language**
  In settings, search for “Copilot: Languages”.

- **Repository-wide Instructions**
  Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with concise guidelines (e.g., coding style, test framework).

- **Temporal Context**
  Allow Copilot to read recently edited files for richer suggestions.

NOTE: Review these settings periodically as new features arrive.

=== 2.7 Taking Advantage of Code Actions

When VS Code detects issues or opportunities, lightbulb icons offer:

- **Rewrite or Optimize with Copilot**
- **Open Inline Chat for deeper edits**

These act as a second opinion to improve code quality.

=== 2.8 Inline Chat vs Sidebar Chat

==== 2.8.1 When to Use Each

. **Inline Chat**
  - Quick fixes in context.
  - Ideal for single functions or lines.
. **Sidebar Chat**
  - Paste larger code snippets.
  - Get explanations alongside code.
  - Suitable for brainstorming design changes.

==== 2.8.2 Example: Optimizing a Python Function

1. Open Sidebar Chat (Command Palette → “Open Chat”).
2. Paste function and ask: “Optimize and add logging.”
3. Review suggestions, click “Apply to Editor” to merge changes.

=== 2.9 Adding Context with References & Shortcuts

You can explicitly provide context:

. Start a new chat with the `+` button.
. Copilot auto-detects your open file and project files.
. Or click “Add context”:
  * Code base
  * Current editor
  * Selection
  * Symbol
. Use hashtags in the prompt:
  * `# file dbBackup.py`
  * `# symbol backup_database`

Example:
----
How can I optimize this file?
# file dbBackup.py
----

Copilot will focus on `dbBackup.py`.

=== 2.10 Inviting Additional Participants

Use shortcuts to bring in files or helpers:

. **Hashtag Shortcuts (`#`)**
  - `# dataProcessor.js` to reference that file.
. **At-Symbol Shortcuts (`@`)**
  - `@VS Code` for editor settings.
  - `@Terminal` for CLI tasks.
  - `@Workspace` to query project structure.
  - `@GitHub` to perform live checks if your repo is online.

=== 2.11 Running Terminal Commands with AI

==== 2.11.1 Chat in the Editor

1. Ask “How do I run this Python script?”
2. Copilot suggests the command.
3. Click “Insert into Terminal”—but always review before running.

==== 2.11.2 Inline Chat in the Terminal

1. Trigger Inline Chat in the terminal.
2. Type: `run db_backup.py with Python 3`.
3. Copilot shows `python3 db_backup.py`.
4. Insert or execute it manually.

TIP: Avoid destructive operations by reviewing commands first.

=== 2.12 Mastering Slash Commands

Copilot Chat supports slash commands both in the terminal and inline.

==== 2.12.1 Terminal Slash Commands

Type `/` in the integrated terminal to see options:

[source,bash]
----
# Example in the terminal
git rebase --interactive HEAD~3
/explain
----

Copilot explains the selected command or opens full chat.

==== 2.12.2 Inline Chat Slash Commands

Select code → press `/` → choose:

- `/explain` – Explains code.
- `/fix` – Attempts to fix issues.
- `/tests` – Generates tests (next lecture).

Example:
. Select code
. Press `/` → choose `/fix` → review suggestion.

==== 2.12.3 Best Practices

- Be explicit with slash commands.
- Add minimal context for clarity.
- Iterate: refine prompts if the first result isn’t perfect.
- Use “View in Chat” for longer explanations.

=== 2.13 Multi-File Edits with Copilot Edits

Copilot Edits (sidebar) orchestrates changes across multiple files.

- **Purpose-Built**
  Handles edits in several files or creates new ones.
- **Workflow**
  1. Ask a multi-file request (e.g., “Add user authentication”).
  2. Use “Add Files” to include relevant sources.
  3. Review coordinated changes in one diff view.
- **Benefits**
  - Streamlines large refactorings.
  - Maintains consistency (imports, file creation).

=== 2.14 Automating Unit Test Generation

Two new slash commands:

. `/doc` – Generates documentation comments (Javadoc, docstrings).
. `/tests` – Creates unit tests for the selected code:

  1. Select the target code.
  2. Press `/` → choose `/tests`.
  3. Copilot suggests a test suite in a new file (e.g., `db_backup_test.py`).

TIP: Provide edge-case instructions (e.g., “focus on error paths”).

=== 2.15 Creating New Projects with `/new`

Scaffold projects instantly:

[source,bash]
----
/new "Create a Node.js project using Express"
----
Copilot prompts for missing details, then generates:

- `src/`, `tests/` directories
- `package.json` with Express dependency
- Starter files

Click **Create Project** and choose a folder to initialize a new workspace.

=== 2.16 Prompt Engineering Essentials

Good prompts = better AI output.

[NOTE]
====
• Be Specific
  State clear goals (e.g., “Write a Python function that validates emails”).
• Provide Context
  Mention frameworks, style guides, or environment details.
• Use Examples
  Show sample input/output for tricky tasks.
• Break Down Complex Tasks
  Divide large features into steps (scaffold → CRUD → validation).
• Iterate
  Treat the first response as a draft; refine with follow-ups.
====

=== 2.17 Improving AI Efficiency with Specificity & Context

Example: Generating Express routes for a reservation API:

. Project has `app.js`; you create `routes/tables.js`.
. Sidebar Chat Prompt:
----
I’m building a restaurant-table reservation API.
In `routes/tables.js`, generate:
• POST /new-reservation – {name, numberOfPeople, date, time}
• DELETE /cancel/:reservationId
Return only the file contents.
----
Copilot returns the complete router code, including `module.exports`.

=== 2.18 Validating Input with Sidebar Chat

Rather than a broad prompt (“Validate input and store in DB”), split tasks:

==== 2.18.1 Adding Validation Only

1. Select your route handler:
+
[source,js]
----
router.post('/reservations', (req, res) => {
 // validation goes here…
});
----
2. Prompt:
----
Add input validation (no external libraries):
• `partySize`: integer 1–6
• `time`: 17:00 to 23:00 every 30m
• `date`: today or future
Provide error responses.
----
3. Review the generated code and integrate.

=== 2.19 Effective Iteration: Balancing AI & Manual Coding

1. You’re in charge – leverage AI for bulk work, not trivial edits.
2. Use AI for large refactorings (e.g., convert require→import across files).
3. Iterate: prompt → review diff → manual tweak → accept.
4. Build a hybrid workflow: AI for scaffolding, you for semantics.

=== 2.20 GitHub Copilot Extensions

Enhance Copilot with domain-specific knowledge.

==== 2.20.1 Copilot-Specific Extensions

Hosted by GitHub (in the Copilot catalog):

- Docker, Terraform, AWS CDK, Kubernetes, etc.
- Install via https://github.com/features/copilot/extensions
- In Chat, add participant: `@Docker`.

==== 2.20.2 General VS Code Extensions

Regular VS Code Marketplace extensions that expose chat participants:

1. In Copilot Chat sidebar, type `@` → **Install Chat Extension**.
2. Search and install (e.g., MongoDB, Azure Tools).
3. Copilot surfaces new participants (e.g., `@MongoDB`).

TIP: Combine both types for full-stack, context-aware AI assistance.

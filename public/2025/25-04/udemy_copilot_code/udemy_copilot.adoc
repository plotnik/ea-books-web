== 2. Leverage GitHub Copilot Suggestions & Chat

=== Using AI Powered Code Suggestions To Write Code

Okay, here's a summary of the provided text:

The text describes the basic usage of GitHub Copilot in an IDE (specifically VS Code) after it has been installed, subscribed to, and logged into. Using a Python example of creating a Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion function, it shows how Copilot provides inline code suggestions as the user types.

Key takeaways mentioned are:

1.  **Suggestion Variability:** Copilot suggestions aren't always the same for everyone or over time due to the nature of AI and model updates. Being more specific in typing can help guide it.
2.  **Multiple Suggestions:** Users can often access multiple different suggestions by pausing after typing, which may reveal a pop-up menu to cycle through options, or by opening the "Completions Panel" for a more detailed list.
3.  **Accepting Suggestions:** Suggestions can be accepted entirely (e.g., with the `Tab` key) or partially (accepting word-by-word using specific shortcuts).

The user demonstrates these features while creating the simple conversion function, ultimately accepting the full code block suggested by Copilot.

=== Using "Next Edit" Suggestions

GitHub Copilot’s “Next Edit Suggestions” in VS Code lets the tool predict and propose your next code change, not just complete the current line. To try it:

1. Open User Settings in VS Code and search for “GitHub Copilot.”  
2. Locate (or enable) the Preview setting called “Next Edit Suggestions.”  
3. Back in your code, make a change—say you rename a variable from `F` to `Fahrenheit`. Copilot will then automatically suggest renaming other occurrences of that variable elsewhere.  
4. Accept the suggestion with Tab or the inline icon, reject with Esc, and adjust settings (e.g. shift code to show both suggestion and existing code).

By anticipating your next edits, this feature lets you move through large files and make bulk changes faster. Originally introduced in Cursor, it’s now integrated into Copilot to boost developer productivity.

=== Mastering Prompts - Using Comments To Guide Github Copilot's AI

The speaker demonstrates how to leverage GitHub Copilot’s ability to turn natural-language comments into working code. Instead of hunting for the “perfect” function name, you can write a comment that describes exactly what you need (e.g. “Function that takes either a Celsius or Fahrenheit temperature and converts it…”). Copilot will read that comment (plus the surrounding file context) and offer suitable code completions—sometimes just a single line, sometimes an entire function.  

Key tips:  

• Treat comments as prompts—write your intent in plain English and let Copilot generate the implementation.  
• If you lose a suggestion, move the cursor up and back down to re-trigger it.  
• Open the Completions panel (⇧⌥I) to get more—and often fuller—alternative snippets.  
• You can place these “prompt” comments anywhere (top-of-file, inside functions, etc.) to guide Copilot’s output.

=== Writing A Full Python Script With Suggestions

The text describes building a Python script to manage SQLite database backups (backing up and restoring). It utilizes **GitHub Copilot's suggestion feature** (not the chat) as the primary AI tool.

1.  **Setup:** Global variables for the active (`app.db`) and backup (`backup.db`) database file paths were defined. Copilot suggested the second variable name, which the user slightly modified.
2.  **Function Generation:** Copilot successfully suggested entire functions for `backup_database` and `restore_database`, including the necessary `shutil` import based on the function code it generated.
3.  **AI Limitations & Developer Intervention:** When attempting to create the main execution logic, Copilot's suggestions were not suitable (e.g., suggesting backing up and immediately restoring). The developer had to manually structure the script, creating a `main` function to handle user interaction.
4.  **User Interaction Logic:** Inside the `main` function, Copilot proved helpful again, suggesting `print` statements for user options (backup, restore, exit), the `input()` call to get user choice, and the `if/elif/else` structure to execute the correct action based on the input.
5.  **Manual Steps:** The developer needed to manually type the call to the `main` function at the end of the script when Copilot didn't suggest it.
6.  **Key Takeaways:**

    *   Copilot is effective at generating boilerplate code, functions, and suggesting imports based on context.
    *   Developers must **evaluate and modify** Copilot's suggestions to fit their needs and coding standards.
    *   AI might not understand the overall program goal correctly, requiring developer intervention for higher-level logic (like the user interaction flow).
    *   It's crucial **not to solely rely on or wait for AI suggestions**; developers should type code manually when necessary for efficiency.
    
7.  **Outcome:** The final script, built with a combination of Copilot suggestions and manual developer input, successfully allowed users to back up and restore the database via a command-line menu.

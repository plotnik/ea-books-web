== 2. Leverage GitHub Copilot Suggestions & Chat

=== Using AI Powered Code Suggestions To Write Code

Okay, here's a summary of the provided text:

The text describes the basic usage of GitHub Copilot in an IDE (specifically VS Code) after it has been installed, subscribed to, and logged into. Using a Python example of creating a Fahrenheit-to-Celsius conversion function, it shows how Copilot provides inline code suggestions as the user types.

Key takeaways mentioned are:

1.  **Suggestion Variability:** Copilot suggestions aren't always the same for everyone or over time due to the nature of AI and model updates. Being more specific in typing can help guide it.
2.  **Multiple Suggestions:** Users can often access multiple different suggestions by pausing after typing, which may reveal a pop-up menu to cycle through options, or by opening the "Completions Panel" for a more detailed list.
3.  **Accepting Suggestions:** Suggestions can be accepted entirely (e.g., with the `Tab` key) or partially (accepting word-by-word using specific shortcuts).

The user demonstrates these features while creating the simple conversion function, ultimately accepting the full code block suggested by Copilot.

=== Using "Next Edit" Suggestions

GitHub Copilot’s “Next Edit Suggestions” in VS Code lets the tool predict and propose your next code change, not just complete the current line. To try it:

1. Open User Settings in VS Code and search for “GitHub Copilot.”  
2. Locate (or enable) the Preview setting called “Next Edit Suggestions.”  
3. Back in your code, make a change—say you rename a variable from `F` to `Fahrenheit`. Copilot will then automatically suggest renaming other occurrences of that variable elsewhere.  
4. Accept the suggestion with Tab or the inline icon, reject with Esc, and adjust settings (e.g. shift code to show both suggestion and existing code).

By anticipating your next edits, this feature lets you move through large files and make bulk changes faster. Originally introduced in Cursor, it’s now integrated into Copilot to boost developer productivity.

=== Mastering Prompts - Using Comments To Guide Github Copilot's AI

The speaker demonstrates how to leverage GitHub Copilot’s ability to turn natural-language comments into working code. Instead of hunting for the “perfect” function name, you can write a comment that describes exactly what you need (e.g. “Function that takes either a Celsius or Fahrenheit temperature and converts it…”). Copilot will read that comment (plus the surrounding file context) and offer suitable code completions—sometimes just a single line, sometimes an entire function.  

Key tips:  

• Treat comments as prompts—write your intent in plain English and let Copilot generate the implementation.  
• If you lose a suggestion, move the cursor up and back down to re-trigger it.  
• Open the Completions panel (⇧⌥I) to get more—and often fuller—alternative snippets.  
• You can place these “prompt” comments anywhere (top-of-file, inside functions, etc.) to guide Copilot’s output.

=== Writing A Full Python Script With Suggestions

The text describes building a Python script to manage SQLite database backups (backing up and restoring). It utilizes **GitHub Copilot's suggestion feature** (not the chat) as the primary AI tool.

1.  **Setup:** Global variables for the active (`app.db`) and backup (`backup.db`) database file paths were defined. Copilot suggested the second variable name, which the user slightly modified.
2.  **Function Generation:** Copilot successfully suggested entire functions for `backup_database` and `restore_database`, including the necessary `shutil` import based on the function code it generated.
3.  **AI Limitations & Developer Intervention:** When attempting to create the main execution logic, Copilot's suggestions were not suitable (e.g., suggesting backing up and immediately restoring). The developer had to manually structure the script, creating a `main` function to handle user interaction.
4.  **User Interaction Logic:** Inside the `main` function, Copilot proved helpful again, suggesting `print` statements for user options (backup, restore, exit), the `input()` call to get user choice, and the `if/elif/else` structure to execute the correct action based on the input.
5.  **Manual Steps:** The developer needed to manually type the call to the `main` function at the end of the script when Copilot didn't suggest it.
6.  **Key Takeaways:**

    *   Copilot is effective at generating boilerplate code, functions, and suggesting imports based on context.
    *   Developers must **evaluate and modify** Copilot's suggestions to fit their needs and coding standards.
    *   AI might not understand the overall program goal correctly, requiring developer intervention for higher-level logic (like the user interaction flow).
    *   It's crucial **not to solely rely on or wait for AI suggestions**; developers should type code manually when necessary for efficiency.
    
7.  **Outcome:** The final script, built with a combination of Copilot suggestions and manual developer input, successfully allowed users to back up and restore the database via a command-line menu.

=== Using The Inline Chat Feature To Add Error Handling

Here’s a concise summary of the key points:

• Copilot isn’t just auto-completion—there’s a chat interface in VS Code built specifically for coding tasks.  
• You can open it in two ways:  

  * Inline (faster): ⇧⌘I (macOS) or Ctrl+I (Windows/Linux)  
  * Sidebar or via Command Palette (“Open Chat” or “Editor: Inline Chat”)  
  
• It’s context-aware, so it reads your surrounding code, and you can even attach screenshots or use voice.  
• To tweak existing code, select the snippet, invoke inline chat, and type a prompt (e.g. “Add error handling”).  
• Copilot then injects changes shown as diffs:  

  * Dark green = unchanged original  
  * Light green = additions  
  * Red = removals  
  
• You can accept, discard, regenerate, toggle diff details, or adjust chat settings.  
• In the demo, adding error checks around the “backup_db” and “restore_db” functions turned a raw crash into a friendly error message when the database file was missing.

=== Configuring GitHub Copilot - Tips For Efficient Use

The content explains how to configure GitHub Copilot's chat features within VS Code. It guides users to access the settings—either for a specific workspace or for all projects—and search for "copilot chat" or "copilot" to find various configuration options. Key points include:

• Adjusting which programming languages GitHub Copilot is enabled for, allowing users to enable or disable suggestions on a per-language basis.

• Using a `copilot-instructions.md` file placed in a `.github` folder, where concise instructions can be provided to influence the style and behavior of Copilot's code generation. The instructions should be clear because poor instructions might lead to less desirable outcomes.

• Utilizing the temporal context feature, which enables Copilot to take into account code from recently edited files, thereby supporting scenarios where code is spread over multiple files.

The content emphasizes the importance of periodically reviewing these settings, as they may evolve over time with updates to AI models and new features, to ensure that Copilot best meets the user's workflow needs.

=== Taking Advantage of Code Actions

The content discusses GitHub Copilot's "code actions" feature. When you select a piece of code, an icon appears that offers context-specific suggestions. For instance, it can suggest rewriting or optimizing your code using Copilot, opening an inline chat for further help and review. Additionally, when an error is detected (like a missing key), a light bulb icon appears that provides suggestions, including fixes from Copilot. This feature essentially acts as a helpful second opinion to improve your code or resolve issues automatically.

=== Exploring The Sidebar Chat For More Complex Tasks

Here’s a clearer, more concise walkthrough of using VS Code’s two chat modes—Inline Chat and Sidebar Chat—so you can pick the right tool for the job:

1. Opening Sidebar Chat  
   - Use the keyboard shortcut (your keymap may vary) or open the Command Palette → “Open Chat.”  
   - This pane is best for larger context, long code snippets, or richer explanations.

2. When to Use Inline Chat vs Sidebar Chat  
   - Inline Chat  
     • Quick edits to a specific function or line.  
     • Lets you hover, ask a question, and receive an edit suggestion right where you need it.  
   - Sidebar Chat  
     • Paste in bigger code blocks or describe complex tasks.  
     • Get a full conversational view—explanations, code, suggestions—in one place.

3. Example: Optimizing a Python Function  
   a. Paste your function into the sidebar chat and ask, “How can I optimize and improve this code?”  
   b. GitHub’s server analyzes it and returns:  
      – Recommendations (e.g. add error handling, switch to the logging module)  
      – A revised code snippet implementing those suggestions  
   c. Next to that snippet you’ll see action buttons:  
      • Apply to Editor – merges changes into your file (smartly adds imports, updates signatures, etc.)  
      • Insert at Cursor – drops code where your cursor sits  
      • Copy – grab it for manual tweaks  
      • Insert into Terminal – useful only for command-line snippets  
      • Create New File – spins up a standalone file  

4. Reviewing & Applying Changes  
   - Click “Apply to Editor.” VS Code will show you a diff:  
     • Green = added code  
     • Red = removed code  
   - You can Accept, Discard, or “Show Changes” for a unified diff view.  
   - If you accept, your file is updated in place with proper imports and consistent style.

5. Verifying Your Updates  
   - Rerun your code.  
   - Now you’ll see structured log output (thanks to the logging module) and proper error messages if, say, a backup file doesn’t exist.

6. When to Reach for Sidebar Chat  
   - You need to paste or reference multiple functions.  
   - You want explanations alongside code.  
   - You’re brainstorming broader design changes, not just tiny inline tweaks.

In short:  

• Use Inline Chat for quick, in-context code tweaks.  
• Use Sidebar Chat when you need more room to ask questions, share larger snippets, or get detailed explanations.

=== Adding Context - Using References & Shortcuts For Smarter Code Creation
Here’s a cleaned-up, step-by-step guide showing how to ask Copilot Chat
to analyze or optimize code across your project—even when you don’t
paste snippets by hand:

[arabic]
. Start a New Chat +
• Click the “+” button to open a fresh conversation. +
• Ask your question, e.g.: “How can I optimize this code?”
. Let Copilot Auto-Detect Context +
• By default it will scan your currently open file (and sometimes the
rest of your project) to gather context. +
• If it already sees the relevant code, it’ll answer without any extra
steps.
. Explicitly Reference Files or Symbols +
If you want to be sure Copilot looks at the right piece of code, add
context yourself:
+
{empty}a. Click the “Add context” button (looks like a page icon) +
– Choose *Code base* to give access to all files. +
– Choose *Current editor* for just the file in your active tab. +
– Choose *Selection* if you’ve highlighted a snippet. +
– Choose *Symbol* to pick a function, class, or variable. +
– You can also pick recently edited files or terminal commands.
+
{empty}b. Type a hash `\#` in the chat box +
– `# file` shows a list of project files (e.g. `+#dbBackup.py+`). +
– `# symbol` lets you pick specific functions or variables. +
– `# editor` or `# selection` similarly restricts scope.
+
Example: +
• In your question box type: +
> How can I optimize this file? +
> # file dbBackup.py
. Ask Your Question +
• After you’ve attached the right context, press Enter. +
• Copilot will read that file (or those symbols) and suggest targeted
improvements— +
e.g. removing redundant logging, consolidating exception blocks, etc.
. Review & Apply Suggestions +
• Copilot often offers one-click “Apply changes” for refactorings. +
• Validate that the proposed edits fit your style and requirements.

— +
By explicitly tagging files or symbols, you ensure Copilot Chat has
exactly the code you want it to analyze, leading to more accurate and
actionable optimization tips.

=== Adding Additional Participants For Enhanced Sidebar Chat Context

When you’re chatting in VS Code—whether in the main sidebar or
inline—two types of shortcuts let you pull in extra context or helper
“participants”:

[arabic]
. *Hashtag shortcuts (`+#+`)* +
Bring in files or code fragments from your workspace. +
• Example: +
– Type `+#utils.js+` to reference the `+utils.js+` file. +
– The AI will see its contents and can generate or modify code based on
it.
. *At-symbol shortcuts (`+@+`)* +
Invite built-in assistants or services into the conversation. Common
ones include: +
• `+@VS Code+` – Ask general questions about editor settings (e.g.
“Where do I tweak the code font size?”). +
• `+@Terminal+` – Get help with command-line tasks. +
• `+@Workspace+` – Query details about your entire project (structure,
configs, dependencies). +
• `+@GitHub+` – (If you’ve pushed your repo) lets the AI perform live
web searches and GitHub-specific checks.

'''''

==== Examples

*1. Referring to another file*

In inline chat, you might write:

....
Generate a function in this file that uses #dataProcessor.js
....

The AI then reads `+dataProcessor.js+` to inform its response.

*2. Asking about VS Code settings*

In the sidebar chat:

....
@VS Code: How can I change my editor’s bracket color?
....

You’ll get pointer links right into your `+settings.json+` UI.

*3. Checking code style with GitHub search*

First, push your code to GitHub. Then in a new chat:

....
@GitHub #main.py  
Does this follow common Python style best practices?
....

The AI will pull in both the file and any relevant web references to
reply.

'''''

*Key Takeaways*

* Use *`+#<filename>+`* to inject specific files or code blocks.
* Use *`+@<assistant>+`* to bring in contextual helpers like VS Code,
Terminal, Workspace, or GitHub.
* Combining both gives the AI maximum context for accurate, tailored
answers.

=== Running Terminal Commands Efficiently With AI

==== 1. Chat in the Editor: Asking about Terminal Commands

[arabic]
. Open the editor-sidebar chat.
. Ask any terminal-related question, for example:
* “How can I use Git to manage this project?”
* “How do I run this Python code?”
. The chat will propose the exact command. +
– If it uses a placeholder (e.g. `+python file.py+`), simply clarify: +
“No—I need the command to run the file I have open.” +
– It will detect your open file (e.g. `+db_backup.py+`) and update the
command.
. Click the “Insert into Terminal” button.
. *Always review* the command before hitting Enter—this avoids
accidental destructive operations.

==== 2. Inline Chat in the Terminal

Instead of switching back to the sidebar, you can invoke the inline chat
directly inside your terminal:

[arabic]
. Open your terminal and trigger the inline chat shortcut (depends on
your setup).
. Type your request, for example:
+
....
run this Python file
....
. If it doesn’t pick up the right filename or interpreter, refine your
prompt:
+
....
run db_backup.py with Python 3
....
. The chat will show the exact command:
+
....
python3 db_backup.py
....
. You can either insert it into the prompt or execute immediately—again,
double-check before you run.

'''''

==== Why This Helps

* *Context-aware*: Knows which file you’re editing.
* *Saves time*: No need to Google or remember obscure flags.
* *Flexible*: Works both in the sidebar and inline in your terminal.

By leveraging both modes, you streamline your workflow and spend less
time hunting for commands—and more time coding.

=== Mastering GitHub Copilot Slash Commands - Explain, Fix & More


Beyond adding context or participants to your chat, GitHub Copilot Chat
provides a set of slash commands to invoke various features quickly. You
can use these commands both in the terminal and inline within your
editor.

'''''

==== 1. Terminal Slash Commands

Type `+/+` in the integrated terminal to see all available commands. For
example:

* `+/explain+` +
Explains the currently selected or typed command.
+
[source,bash]
----
# Suppose you have this command in your terminal:
git rebase --interactive HEAD~3

# Simply type
/explain
----
+
Copilot will pop up a brief explanation. If you prefer a full dialog,
click *View in Chat* to see the explanation in the main chat window.

'''''

==== 2. Inline Chat Slash Commands

You can also select a block of code in your editor, press `+/+`, and
choose a command that operates on that selection. Common inline commands
include:

* `+/explain+` +
Automatically explains the selected code block.
* `+/fix+` +
Attempts to fix issues in the selected code. You can add a free-form
instruction, e.g., “Use print instead of the logging package,” or just
run `+/fix+` and let Copilot infer your intent.
* `+/tests+` +
Generates unit tests or test scaffolding for the selected code (covered
in the next lecture).

===== Example: Explaining Code Inline

[arabic]
. Select your code snippet.
. Press `+/+` and choose */explain*.
. A small preview appears. Click *View in Chat* for the full
explanation.

===== Example: Fixing Code Inline

[arabic]
. Select the code you want to modify.
. Press `+/+` and choose */fix*.
. Optionally type a comment, e.g., “Don’t use the `+logging+` package.”
. Review Copilot’s suggestion and *Accept* or *Discard*.

'''''

==== 3. Best Practices

* *Be explicit with slash commands.* +
While you could simply ask Copilot to “fix this code,” using `+/fix+`
signals your intention more clearly.
* *Add minimal but sufficient context.* +
Short comments (e.g., “Make this function pure”) help Copilot tailor its
suggestions without overwhelming it.
* *Iterate interactively.* +
If the first suggestion isn’t quite right, refine your instruction or
try a different slash command.
* *Use “View in Chat”* +
For longer explanations or multi‐step refactorings, opening the full
chat window gives you more space to review and interact.

'''''

==== 4. What’s Next?

In the next lecture, we’ll deep-dive into `+/tests+`—how to
automatically generate and run unit tests using GitHub Copilot Chat.

=== Multi-File Edits with Copilot Edits

You’re already familiar with Copilot’s inline chat and its sidebar chat:
both let you ask questions, generate code, reference files, and
collaborate. Copilot Edits is a third, specialized mode in the sidebar
designed specifically for multi-file editing sessions. Here’s what makes
it different:

[arabic]
. Purpose-built for multi-file edits +
• Instead of returning one long answer that you must copy-and-paste into
different files, Copilot Edits organizes and applies changes across your
project. +
• It can suggest creating entirely new files when needed and will
propose the exact edits in each affected file.
. How it works +
• Ask your usual questions—e.g., _“Add user authentication”_ — and use *“Add
Files”* to bring in any relevant source files. +
• When you submit your prompt, Copilot Edits analyzes the context,
determines which files to modify (or create), and presents a set of
coordinated changes. +
• You review and approve these edits in one place, rather than juggling
snippets across multiple windows.
. Key benefits +
• Streamlines large refactorings or feature additions that span several
modules or packages +
• Reduces manual overhead—no more copying code between files +
• Maintains consistency by handling imports, references, and file
creation for you

Copilot Edits takes inspiration from Cursor’s Composer feature (which
we’ll cover later in the course) but is fully integrated into GitHub
Copilot. If you’re about to tackle any change that touches multiple
files, give Copilot Edits a try—it could save you a lot of time and
errors.

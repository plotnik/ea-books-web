== Leveraging The Docs Integration For Better Code Generation

I’ve switched back to the Node.js/Express project from the previous
section to explore Cursor’s chat features—especially its “Docs”
integration. Here’s what I did:

[arabic]
. *Problem Statement* +
My app has a `+public/+` folder full of static assets (images,
stylesheets, etc.). I want any incoming HTTP request for those files to
be served directly by Express, with no extra routing or middleware
logic.
. *Naïve Prompt* +
I could simply ask the chat assistant: +
_“Add code to serve files from the public folder statically.”_ +
That might work, but I want to be 100% sure I’m using the correct
Express API.
. *Using Cursor’s Docs Feature*
* Cursor offers built-in documentation for dozens of popular libraries
(React, AWS SDKs, Django, Node.js core, Express, and more).
* If your library isn’t listed, you can supply a URL or paste in
external docs; Cursor will ingest them for future prompts.
* I selected the official Express.js documentation from Cursor’s Docs
sidebar.
. *Generated Solution* +
After hitting “Generate,” Cursor produced exactly what I needed:
+
[source,js]
----
const path = require('path');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// Serve all files in /public statically
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

// ...your other routes and middleware
----
. *Why This Matters* +
AI models often train on older data and might not know the latest
libraries or APIs. By feeding in up-to-date docs, Cursor can reference
the exact methods and signatures you need—ensuring the generated code is
both correct and current.

In short, Cursor’s Docs feature makes it trivial to add—even
nonstandard—libraries to your chat context, dramatically improving the
reliability of AI-generated code.

== Editing Multiple Files & Performing More Complex Edits With Cursor Composer Mode

Cursor offers several ways to work with your code:

[arabic]
. Inline completion suggestions
. Inline chat (edit mode)
. External chat panel
. Composer mode (multi-file edits)

You’ll encounter all of these throughout the course, and you can
experiment with them in your own projects. Below we’ll focus on Composer
mode—what it is, how to open it, and why you might choose it.


=== 1. Opening Composer Mode

* Default shortcut:
** macOS: ⌘ + I
** Windows/Linux: Ctrl + I
* In newer Cursor versions, it appears as a *sidebar* rather than an
overlay.
* You can switch between three sub-modes: +
• Ask (chat-only) +
• Agent (powerful; can run commands & create files) +
• Edit (legacy code-only edits)

==== Which sub-mode to use?

Use *Agent mode*. It:

* Understands and edits your code
* Runs commands (always asks for confirmation)
* Creates new files or folders when needed

If you only want suggestions or Q&A without file operations, choose
*Ask*. If you just need in-place code edits, *Edit* works fine.

=== 2. Composer’s Purpose

Composer streamlines *multi-file*, *complex* changes by letting you:

* Draft a single “big-picture” instruction
* See, review, and tweak all suggested edits in one place
* Accept or reject each change as a diff
* Apply the whole batch atomically

You could do similar work via chat or inline completions, but Composer
keeps everything organized.

=== 3. Example: Adding Authentication

[arabic]
. Open Composer (Agent mode).
. (Optional) Load your entire codebase as context.
. Enter a clear prompt, for example: +
```
Add user authentication. 
- POST /users/signup for sign-up 
- POST /users/login for login 
- Store data in SQLite 
- Use JWT for tokens
```
. Composer analyzes your code and proposes
* New files (e.g. `+src/routes/users.js+`, `+database.js+`)
* Updates to existing files (e.g. `+app.js+`, `+tables.js+`)
. Inspect the diff view—green = additions, red = removals.
. If you want an adjustment (e.g. _“Initialize DB in a separate file, not
in `+users.js+`”_), type a follow-up instruction.
. Composer regenerates its proposed changes. Review again.
. When you’re satisfied, click *Accept* to apply all edits to your
project.


=== 4. Why Use Composer?

* *Visibility*: See every file change before it happens
* *Control*: Tweak or reject individual edits
* *Efficiency*: Batch multi-file refactors in one workflow

That said, you can mix and match tools—inline completions, chat, or
Composer—depending on your preference and the complexity of the task.
Composer is simply a convenient way to tackle larger, multi-file edits
without losing context.

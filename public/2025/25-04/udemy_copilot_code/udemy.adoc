Visual Studio Code’s Copilot Chat “Ask mode” lets you query your
codebase and general tech topics in plain English. Here’s how it works:

[arabic]
. Enabling Ask mode +
• Open the Chat view (Copilot menu or Ctrl + ⌘ I). +
• Choose “Ask” from the mode dropdown. +
• Type your question and press Enter.
. Adding context +
• Click “Add Context” or type “#” to reference files, folders, or
`+#codebase+`. +
• Drag-and-drop files into the chat to include them.
. Receiving and applying responses +
• Answers can include code blocks, terminal commands, links, etc. +
• Hover a code block and choose *Apply in Editor* to merge it smartly. +
• Shell commands can be inserted into the integrated terminal with
*Insert into Terminal*.
. Quick Chat +
• For one-off questions, open *Quick Chat* from the Copilot menu. +
• Promote a quick exchange to the full Chat view with *Open in Chat
View*.
. Special keywords +
• @participants (e.g. `+@workspace+`, `+@terminal+`, `+@github+`) let
you tap domain-specific helpers. +
• /slash-commands (e.g. `+/fix+`, `+/explain+`) trigger common
actions. +
• #variables (e.g. `+#file+`, `+#codebase+`) reference context directly
in your prompt.

With Ask mode, you can explore design patterns, understand or refactor
code, generate snippets, and more—all without leaving VS Code.

== Use ask mode in VS Code

> https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-ask-mode

Visual Studio Code’s Copilot Chat *“Ask mode”* lets you query your
codebase and general tech topics in plain English. Here’s how it works:

[arabic]
. Enabling Ask mode +
• Open the Chat view (Copilot menu or kbd:[Ctrl + ⌘ I]). +
• Choose “Ask” from the mode dropdown. +
• Type your question and press Enter.
. Adding context +
• Click “Add Context” or type “#” to reference files, folders, or
`+#codebase+`. +
• Drag-and-drop files into the chat to include them.
. Receiving and applying responses +
• Answers can include code blocks, terminal commands, links, etc. +
• Hover a code block and choose *Apply in Editor* to merge it smartly. +
• Shell commands can be inserted into the integrated terminal with
*Insert into Terminal*.
. Quick Chat +
• For one-off questions, open *Quick Chat* from the Copilot menu. +
• Promote a quick exchange to the full Chat view with *Open in Chat
View*.
. Special keywords +
• @participants (e.g. `+@workspace+`, `+@terminal+`, `+@github+`) let
you tap domain-specific helpers. +
• /slash-commands (e.g. `+/fix+`, `+/explain+`) trigger common
actions. +
• #variables (e.g. `+#file+`, `+#codebase+`) reference context directly
in your prompt.

With Ask mode, you can explore design patterns, understand or refactor
code, generate snippets, and more—all without leaving VS Code.


== Use edit mode in VS Code

> https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/copilot-edits

Here’s a concise overview of VS Code’s Copilot Chat “edit mode” and how
to use it:

• What it is +
– A natural-language interface for making code edits across one or more
files +
– Edits stream directly into the editor so you can see them in context

• How to get started

[arabic]
. Open the Chat view (kbd:[⌃⌘I] or *Open Chat* in the Copilot menu)
. Switch the mode dropdown to *Edit*
. Click *Add Context* to include files or folders (or use `#codebase` if
you’ve enabled code search)
. Enter your edit prompt (e.g. _“Refactor calculate() for performance”_)
. Copilot will suggest inline changes—navigate them with the overlay
controls

• Reviewing edits +
– The Chat view lists changed files; tabs and Explorer items show
pending edits +
– Use *Keep* / *Undo* (or *Accept All* / *Discard All*) to apply or
reject edits +
– An auto-accept delay can be configured; you can hover to cancel the
countdown

• Reverting and redoing +
– *Undo Last Edit* and *Redo Last Edit* buttons in the Chat view revert
or reapply the most recent request +
– You can also undo all edits from a specific request via the “x”
control in the request list

• Key settings +
– `chat.editing.autoAcceptDelay`: milliseconds before auto-accept (0 to
disable) +
– `chat.editing.confirmEditRequestRemoval/Retry`: prompt before
undo/redo +
– `github.copilot.chat.codesearch.enabled` (preview): power `#codebase`
file finding +
– `chat.implicitContext.enabled` (experimental) for auto-adding the active
editor as context

• Useful keyboard shortcuts +
– kbd:[⇧⌘I]: open Copilot Edits view +
– kbd:[⌥⌘Enter]: send prompt to edit mode +
– kbd:[⌘/]: attach context +
– kbd:[⌘Enter] / kbd:[⌘Backspace]: accept/discard all edits +
– kbd:[⇧⌥F5] / kbd:[⌥F5]: navigate edits within a file

• Limitations +
– No simultaneous edit sessions or project scaffolding with
`+@workspace /new+` in edit mode +
– Custom and binary file formats aren’t supported or tested +
– `#codebase` results can vary—experiment with explicit context or the
code-search preview

• When to choose edit mode vs. agent mode +
– Edit mode is best for targeted code changes when you know the scope +
– Agent mode can discover context and iterate more autonomously but may
be slower and less predictable

== Use agent mode in VS Code

> https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode

Here’s a concise overview of Copilot’s “agent mode” in VS Code:

[arabic]
. What Agent Mode Is +
• An autonomous editing session where Copilot: +
– Plans what to do +
– Picks relevant files and context +
– Makes code changes and runs tools/commands +
– Monitors results, runs tests, and iterates to fix errors
. Getting Started +
• Enable agent mode via the chat.agent.enabled setting (VS Code 1.99+) +
• Open the Chat view (kbd:[⌃⌘I]) and pick “Agent” from the mode dropdown +
• Type a high-level request (e.g. _“Create a React/Node meal-planner”_)—no
need to name files
. How It Works +
• Copilot decides which built-in, MCP, or extension-provided tools to
invoke (file listing, editing, terminal, etc.) +
• You confirm any tool or terminal commands before they run +
• You can configure tool approvals per session, workspace, or always;
reset approvals via *“Chat: Reset Tool Confirmations”* +
• Optionally auto-approve all tools with the experimental
chat.tools.autoApprove setting
. Reviewing & Accepting Changes +
• Suggested edits appear directly in the editor; changed files are
listed in the Chat view and Explorer +
• Use the overlay controls (kbd:[Up/Down] arrows) to navigate hunks +
• Click “Keep” or “Undo” per hunk, file, or all edits +
• You can set `chat.editing.autoAcceptDelay` to auto-accept after a delay
. Undo/Redo & Revert +
• “Undo Last Edit” and “Redo Last Edit” in the Chat view let you step
backward/forward through requests +
• Hover over a specific request to “Undo Edits (Delete)” from that point
onward
. Interrupting a Request +
• “Pause” halts processing and lets you continue or enter a new prompt +
• “Cancel” stops the run but retains edits made so far, which you can
still accept or reject
. Key Settings +
• `chat.agent.enabled`: on/off (default false) +
• `chat.agent.maxRequests`: max backend calls per prompt (default 5-15) +
• `github.copilot.chat.agent.runTasks`: whether to run workspace tasks
(default true) +
• `chat.mcp.discovery.enabled`: MCP server discovery (default true) +
• `chat.tools.autoApprove` (experimental): auto-approve all tools (default
false)
. When to Use Agent vs. Edit Mode +
• Agent Mode: best for complex, multi-file tasks that may need builds,
tests or external tools, and self-healing workflows +
• Edit Mode: quicker for simple, scoped edits when you know exactly
which file/region to change

By following these steps and controls, agent mode lets Copilot take
end-to-end responsibility for planning, applying, and validating code
changes in your workspace.

== Adding Actuator to Your Application

You are planning to develop a new RESTful API to complement your
football-related suite of services and want to ensure your application
is responsive and resilient. To effectively monitor your application's
health, you'll be utilizing *Spring Boot Actuator*.

=== What is Spring Boot Actuator?

Spring Boot Actuator provides a set of production-ready functionalities
packaged with the Spring Framework. It includes various built-in tools
and endpoints designed to monitor, manage, and interact with Spring Boot
applications in production environments. The Actuator simplifies
understanding and addressing runtime behaviors in Spring Boot
applications by exposing multiple endpoints, including *health*,
*metrics*, *info*, *dump*, and *env*.

Once the Actuator dependency is included in your application, you'll
have access to numerous out-of-the-box endpoints, which can be
customized or extended according to your needs.

=== Getting Started

In this section, we'll create an application using the _Spring
Initializr_ tool. You can access this tool either through your browser
at https://start.spring.io[https://start.spring.io] or by integrating it
into your favorite code editor.

=== Steps to Include Actuator

Follow these steps to create a project with Actuator enabled and explore
the provided endpoints:

[arabic]
. *Create a New Project*:
* Open https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr].
* Use the same parameters as in the _Creating a RESTful API_ recipe from
link:restful.html#_creating_a_restful_api[Chapter 1], changing the following options:
** *Artifact*: `+footballobs+`
** *Dependencies*: Select *Spring Web* and *Spring Boot Actuator*.
. *Download and Unzip the Project*:
* Download the generated template and unzip it into your working
directory.
. *Configure Actuator Endpoints*:
* Before running your application, create an `+application.yml+` file in
the `+src/main/resources+` folder and add the following configuration:

[source,yaml]
----
management:
  endpoints:
    web:
      exposure:
        include: health, env, metrics, beans, loggers
----

[arabic, start=4]
. *Run Your Application*:
* Start your application. You can now access the exposed Actuator
endpoints:
** *Health Endpoint*: `+http://localhost:8080/actuator/health+` –
Provides health information about your application.
** *Environment Endpoint*: `+http://localhost:8080/actuator/env+` –
Returns the environment variables of the application.
** *Metrics Endpoint*: `+http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics+` –
Lists the metrics exposed by the application. For specific metrics,
append the metric name (e.g.,
`+http://localhost:8080/actuator/metrics/process.cpu.usage+`).
** *Beans Endpoint*: `+http://localhost:8080/actuator/beans+` – Lists
the beans registered in the IoC container.
** *Loggers Endpoint*: `+http://localhost:8080/actuator/loggers+` –
Displays log levels and loggers of the application and allows runtime
modification of log levels.
. *Explore Additional Endpoints*:
* You have only exposed a subset of the available endpoints. For a
complete list, refer to the official documentation:
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/actuator.html#actuator.endpoints[Spring
Boot Actuator Endpoints].

=== How It Works

Integrating Actuator into your application provides a variety of
endpoints for monitoring and managing application behavior. By default,
all endpoints except the shutdown endpoint are enabled. The shutdown
endpoint allows for graceful application termination. You can expose
endpoints via HTTP requests or JMX, with HTTP being preferred for
standard monitoring tools.

Additional components, such as Spring Data JPA, may expose more metrics
that require configuration for monitoring purposes.

=== Security Considerations

Some Actuator endpoints may expose sensitive information. By default,
only the health endpoint is exposed. Depending on your application’s
accessibility, you may want to secure other endpoints. You can implement
security configurations, as demonstrated below:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {
    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain filterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        return http
            .authorizeHttpRequests(authorize ->
                authorize.requestMatchers("/actuator/**")
                    .hasRole("ADMIN")
                    .anyRequest().authenticated())
            .oauth2ResourceServer(oauth2 -> oauth2.jwt(Customizer.withDefaults()))
            .build();
    }
}
----

For more details on securing Actuator endpoints, refer to the official
documentation:

Actuator Endpoints].

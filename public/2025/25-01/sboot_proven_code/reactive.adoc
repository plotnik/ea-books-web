== Creating a Reactive RESTful API with Spring WebFlux

Spring Reactive is part of the Spring framework that offers features for
reactive programming, allowing us to build asynchronous and non-blocking
applications with Spring Boot. Reactive programming is beneficial for
applications that need to handle high concurrency and scalability, such
as web applications with numerous simultaneous connections or real-time
data processing systems.

In this guide, we will create a RESTful API using Spring WebFlux, which
is specifically designed for building reactive web applications.

=== Steps to Create the API

Follow these steps to create a RESTful API using reactive programming:

[arabic]
. *Generate a Spring Boot Project:*
* Go to https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr].
* Use the same parameters as in link:restful.hrml[Chapter 1] from the *Creating a RESTful API* recipe, with the following
changes:
** Set *Artifact* to *cards*.
** Under *Dependencies*, select *Spring Reactive Web*.
. *Create a Card Record:*
* In the *cards* project, create a record named *Card*. Define it as
follows:
+
[source,java]
----
public record Card(String cardId, String album, String player, int ranking) {
}
----
. *Add a Cards Controller:*
* Create a controller named *CardsController*:
+
[source,java]
----
@RequestMapping("/cards")
@RestController
public class CardsController {
----
* Within the controller, add a method to retrieve all cards:
+
[source,java]
----
@GetMapping
public Flux<Card> getCards() {
    return Flux.fromIterable(List.of(
        new Card("1", "WWC23", "Ivana Andres", 7),
        new Card("2", "WWC23", "Alexia Putellas", 1)));
}
----
* Add another method to retrieve a specific card:
+
[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/{cardId}")
public Mono<Card> getCard(@PathVariable String cardId) {
    return Mono.just(new Card(cardId, "WWC23", "Superplayer", 1));
}
----
+
In WebFlux, `+Flux<T>+` is used to represent a stream of objects, while
`+Mono<T>+` represents a single object. In traditional programming,
these would correspond to returning `+List<T>+` and `+T+`, respectively.
. *Create a Custom Exception:*
* Add an exception class named *SampleException*:
+
[source,java]
----
public class SampleException extends RuntimeException {
    public SampleException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
----
. *Implement Error Handling:*
* Add two more methods to *CardsController* to demonstrate error
handling:
+
[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/exception")
public Mono<Card> getException() {
    throw new SampleException("This is a sample exception");
}

@ExceptionHandler(SampleException.class)
public ProblemDetail handleSampleException(SampleException e) {
    ProblemDetail problemDetail = ProblemDetail
        .forStatusAndDetail(HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, e.getMessage());
    problemDetail.setTitle("Sample Exception");
    return problemDetail;
}
----
+
The `+getException+` method always throws an exception, while
`+handleSampleException+` manages exceptions of type *SampleException*.
. *Run the Application:*
* Open a terminal in the root folder of the *cards* project and execute:
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----
+
This command will start the RESTful API server.
. *Test the API:*
* You can test the application by sending a request to
`+http://localhost:8080/cards+` using *curl*:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/cards
----
* To see how error handling works, request
`+http://localhost:8080/exception+`. This will return an *HTTP 400*
response.

=== Understanding the Implementation

In this implementation, we used the same annotations found in Spring Web
to define the controllers, but we returned *Mono* and *Flux* types
instead of traditional objects, indicating that responses will be
generated asynchronously.

==== Key Concepts:

* *Non-blocking*: Operations related to I/O (like HTTP requests) avoid
blocking threads, enabling high concurrency without needing a dedicated
thread for each request.
* *Backpressure*: A mechanism ensuring that data is produced only as
quickly as it can be consumed, preventing resource exhaustion.

=== Additional Information

In addition to the annotation-based programming model, WebFlux also
supports a *functional programming* model for defining routes and
handling requests. Hereâ€™s how to achieve the same functionality as the
*cards* RESTful API using a functional approach:

[arabic, start=8]
. *Create a Cards Handler Class:*
+
[source,java]
----
public class CardsHandler {
    public Flux<Card> getCards() {
        return Flux.fromIterable(List.of(
            new Card("1", "WWC23", "Ivana Andres", 7),
            new Card("2", "WWC23", "Alexia Putellas", 1)));
    }

    public Mono<Card> getCard(String cardId) {
        return Mono.just(new Card(cardId, "WWC23", "Superplayer", 1));
    }
}
----
. *Configure the Application with Functional Routing:*
+
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class CardsRouterConfig {
    @Bean
    CardsHandler cardsHandler() {
        return new CardsHandler();
    }

    @Bean
    RouterFunction<ServerResponse> getCards() {
        return route(GET("/cards"), req ->
            ok().body(cardsHandler().getCards(), Card.class));
    }

    @Bean
    RouterFunction<ServerResponse> getCard() {
        return route(GET("/cards/{cardId}"), req ->
            ok().body(cardsHandler().getCard(req.pathVariable("cardId")), Card.class));
    }
}
----

==== Choosing a Programming Model

While the annotation-based approach resembles traditional non-reactive
programming, the functional programming style can be more expressive,
especially for complex routing scenarios. The functional style is
inherently better for handling high concurrency and non-blocking
scenarios, as it integrates seamlessly with reactive programming.

The choice between annotation-based and functional programming is
largely a matter of personal preference.


== Using a Reactive API Client

In this guide, we will create a reactive RESTful API client that
consumes another RESTful API in a non-blocking fashion using Spring
WebClient.

Make sure to run the target project, as we will be consuming its API.

=== Steps to Create a Reactive Consumer Application

Follow these steps to set up your reactive application:

[arabic]
. *Create a New Application:*
* Use the https://start.spring.io/[Spring Boot Initializr] to create a
new application.
* Use the same options as in the *Creating a RESTful API* recipe from
*Chapter 1*, but modify the following:
** *Artifact*: `+consumer+`
** *Dependencies*: Select *Spring Reactive Web*
. *Configure Application Properties:*
* Open the `+application.yml+` file in the `+src/main/resources+`
folder.
* Update it with the following content to set the server port and the
target football service URL:
+
[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 8090
footballservice:
  url: http://localhost:8080
----
. *Create a Record for Card:*
* Create a new record named `+Card+` with the following code:
+
[source,java]
----
public record Card(String cardId, String album, String player, int ranking) {}
----
. *Create the Consumer Controller:*
* Create a controller class named `+ConsumerController+` with a
`+WebClient+` instance:
+
[source,java]
----
@RequestMapping("/consumer")
@RestController
public class ConsumerController {
    private final WebClient webClient;

    public ConsumerController(@Value("${footballservice.url}") String footballServiceUrl) {
        this.webClient = WebClient.create(footballServiceUrl);
    }
}
----
* This controller will allow us to perform non-blocking requests to the
target API.
. *Method to Get All Cards:*
* Add the following method to the `+ConsumerController+` to retrieve a
stream of `+Card+` instances:
+
[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/cards")
public Flux<Card> getCards() {
    return webClient.get()
            .uri("/cards")
            .retrieve()
            .bodyToFlux(Card.class);
}
----
. *Method to Get a Specific Card:*
* Add this method to retrieve a single `+Card+`:
+
[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/cards/{cardId}")
public Mono<Card> getCard(@PathVariable String cardId) {
    return webClient.get()
            .uri("/cards/" + cardId)
            .retrieve()
            .onStatus(HttpStatus::is4xxClientError, response -> Mono.empty())
            .bodyToMono(Card.class);
}
----
. *Method to Handle Errors:*
* Create a method to manage different response codes from the remote
server:
+
[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/error")
public Mono<String> getFailedRequest() {
    return webClient.get()
            .uri("/invalidpath")
            .exchangeToMono(response -> {
                if (response.statusCode().equals(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)) {
                    return Mono.just("Server returned 404");
                } else if (response.statusCode().equals(HttpStatus.INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR)) {
                    return Mono.just("Server returned 500: " + response.bodyToMono(String.class));
                } else {
                    return response.bodyToMono(String.class);
                }
            });
}
----
. *Run the Consumer Application:*
* Open a terminal in the root folder of the `+consumer+` project and
execute:
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----
* This will start your application on port *8090*, while the server
application runs on port *8080*.
. *Test the Consumer Application:*
* Test the endpoints using `+curl+` commands in your terminal:
** Retrieve all cards:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8090/consumer/cards
----
** Retrieve a specific card with ID 7:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8090/consumer/cards/7
----
** Test the error handling:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8090/consumer/error
----

=== How It Works

In this guide, we built a consumer application that interacts with a
RESTful API using reactive programming principles. The non-blocking
nature of the WebClient allows the consumer application to handle
multiple requests efficiently without blocking threads, thus improving
concurrency compared to traditional blocking applications.

By leveraging reactive technologies, your application can perform better
under load, making it suitable for high-performance use cases.

== Testing Reactive Applications

To ensure that our reactive Spring Boot applications are robust and
reliable, we need to automate their testing. Spring Boot provides
excellent support for testing reactive applications, especially when you
include the *Spring Reactive Web* starter.

In this guide, weâ€™ll learn how to create tests using the components that
Spring Boot provides by default.

=== Steps to Create Tests

==== 1. Verify Dependencies

Ensure that your *pom.xml* file contains the necessary dependencies for
testing. If you created your application with the Spring Boot Initializr
tool and added the Spring Reactive Web starter, the testing dependencies
should already be included:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.projectreactor</groupId>
    <artifactId>reactor-test</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

==== 2. Create Tests for the Cards Application

[arabic]
. Create a new test class named *CardsControllerTest* in the
*src/test/java/com/packt/cards* folder. The class should be annotated
with *@WebFluxTest*:
+
[source,java]
----
@WebFluxTest(CardsController.class)
public class CardsControllerTests {
----
. Inject a *WebTestClient* field using the *@Autowired* annotation:
+
[source,java]
----
@Autowired
WebTestClient webTestClient;
----
. Use the *webTestClient* to emulate calls to the reactive RESTful API.
Create a test method for the */cards* path that returns a list of type
*Card*:
+
[source,java]
----
@Test
void testGetCards() {
    webTestClient.get()
            .uri("/cards")
            .exchange()
            .expectStatus().isOk()
            .expectBodyList(Card.class);
}
----
. Create a test for the */cards/exception* path, which always returns a
404 status code:
+
[source,java]
----
@Test
void testGetException() {
    webTestClient.get()
            .uri("/cards/exception")
            .exchange()
            .expectStatus().isBadRequest()
            .expectBody(ProblemDetail.class);
}
----

==== 3. Create Tests for the Consumer Application

Since we want to test the *consumer* application independently of the
*cards* application, we need to mock the *cards* application server
using WireMock.

[arabic]
. Open the *pom.xml* file of the *consumer* project and add the
following dependency:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.tomakehurst</groupId>
    <artifactId>wiremock-standalone</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----
. Create a new test class named *ConsumerControllerTest*. Annotate the
class with *@SpringBootTest* and set the configuration options:
+
[source,java]
----
@SpringBootTest(
    webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT,
    classes = {ConsumerApplication.class, ConsumerController.class, ConsumerControllerTests.Config.class})
public class ConsumerControllerTests {
----
. Create a configuration subclass named *Config* to define a
*WireMockServer* bean:
+
[source,java]
----
@TestConfiguration
static class Config {
    @Bean
    public WireMockServer webServer() {
        WireMockServer wireMockServer = new WireMockServer(7979);
        wireMockServer.start();
        return wireMockServer;
    }
}
----
. Set the URI for the mocked server using *@DynamicPropertySource*:
+
[source,java]
----
@DynamicPropertySource
static void setProperties(DynamicPropertyRegistry registry) {
    registry.add("footballservice.url", () -> "http://localhost:7979");
}
----
. Inject *WebTestClient* and *WireMockServer* into the test class:
+
[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private WebTestClient webTestClient;
@Autowired
private WireMockServer server;
----
. Write a test method to retrieve the cards:
+
[source,java]
----
@Test
public void getCards() {
    server.stubFor(WireMock.get(WireMock.urlEqualTo("/cards"))
        .willReturn(WireMock.aResponse()
            .withStatus(200)
            .withHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
            .withBody("""
            [
                {
                    "cardId": "1",
                    "album": "WWC23",
                    "player": "Ivana Andres",
                    "ranking": 7
                },
                {
                    "cardId": "2",
                    "album": "WWC23",
                    "player": "Alexia Putellas",
                    "ranking": 1
                }
            ]""")));

    webTestClient.get().uri("/consumer/cards")
        .exchange().expectStatus().isOk()
        .expectBodyList(Card.class).hasSize(2)
        .contains(new Card("1", "WWC23", "Ivana Andres", 7),
                  new Card("2", "WWC23", "Alexia Putellas", 1));
}
----

=== How It Works

Using the *@WebFluxTest* annotation allows us to focus on testing only
WebFlux-related components, disabling the configuration of all other
components. This includes configuring classes annotated with
*@Controller* or *@RestController* while excluding classes annotated
with *@Service*. This setup enables Spring Boot to inject
*WebTestClient*, which facilitates performing requests to our
application server.

In the consumer application, we mocked the *cards* service using a
configuration subclass annotated with *@TestConfiguration*. This allows
us to define beans that can be used in tests. We also dynamically
configured the URI for the mocked server using the
*@DynamicPropertySource* annotation.

NOTE: To reference the *Config* class, we used
*ConsumerControllerTests.Config*. This is necessary because it's a
subclass of the *ConsumerControllerTests* class.

The *webEnvironment* field is set to
*SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT*, which allows the test to
host the application as a service on a random port to prevent port
collisions with any remote server.

====

A *RESTful API* is a standardized way for software components to
communicate over the internet using HTTP methods and URLs. It is
fundamental for modern web and cloud application development, promoting
scalable, flexible, and stateless communication. Understanding RESTful
APIs is crucial for building and integrating services.

In this chapter, you'll create a system to manage a football
card-trading game, encompassing teams, players, albums, and cards.
Specifically, you will create a RESTful API that exposes *Create, Read,
Update, and Delete* (*CRUD*) operations for football players.

=== Getting Started

To create a RESTful API, we'll use *Spring Boot* and a tool named
*Spring Initializr*. Open the tool in your browser by navigating to
https://start.spring.io/[https://start.spring.io/]. This tool helps you
generate a Spring Boot project with all necessary dependencies. It
integrates well with code editors like *VSCode* and *IntelliJ* (Premium
edition).

=== Step-by-Step Instructions

Follow these steps to create a RESTful project using Spring Initializr
and establish your first endpoint with typical HTTP operations:

==== 1. Configure Your Project

[arabic]
. Open https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr] in your browser.
. Set the following configuration:
* *Project*: Select *Maven*
* *Language*: Select *Java*
* *Spring Boot*: Choose the latest stable version (at the time of
writing, it's *3.1.4*)
* *Dependencies*: Select *Spring Web*
* *Project Metadata*:
** *Group*: `+com.packt+`
** *Artifact*: `+football+`
** *Name*: Leave autogenerated
** *Package name*: Leave autogenerated
** *Description*: Enter a description like *Demo project for Spring Boot
3 Cookbook*
** *Packaging*: Select *Jar*
** *Java*: Select *21*
. After configuring the options, choose one of the following:
* *Explore*: To explore the project before downloading.
* *Share*: Generates a URL to share your configuration (e.g.,
https://start.spring.io/#!type=maven-project&language=java&platformVersion=3.1.3&packaging=jar&jvmVersion=17&groupId=compackt&artifactId=football&name=football&description=Demo%20project%20for%20Spring%20Boot%203%20Cookbook&packageName=com.packt.football&dependencies=web[this
example]).
* *Generate*: Click this option to download a ZIP file of the project
structure.

==== 2. Set Up Your Project

[arabic]
. Unzip the downloaded file. You now have the basic project structure,
although no API exists yet. If you run the application now, you'll
receive an HTTP 404 Not Found response.
. In the *src/main/java/com/packt/football* folder, create a file named
*PlayerController.java* with the following content to create a RESTful
endpoint:
+
[source,java]
----
package com.packt.football;
import java.util.List;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RequestMapping("/players")
@RestController
public class PlayerController {
   @GetMapping
   public List<String> listPlayers() {
      return List.of("Ivana ANDRES", "Alexia PUTELLAS");
   }
}
----

==== 3. Run the Application

[arabic]
. Open a terminal in the project root folder and execute the following
command:
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----
+
This command builds your project and starts the application. By default,
the web container listens on port *8080*.
. To test the endpoint, execute an HTTP request. You can either open
http://localhost:8080/players in a browser or use `+curl+`:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/players
----
+
You should see a list of players returned by the controller.

==== 4. Enhance Your RESTful API

Add more HTTP verbs to your RESTful endpoint by modifying the
*PlayerController.java* file:

[arabic]
. Implement a *POST* request to create a player:
+
[source,java]
----
@PostMapping
public String createPlayer(@RequestBody String name) {
     return "Player " + name + " created";
}
----
. Add a *GET* request to return a specific player:
+
[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/{name}")
public String readPlayer(@PathVariable String name) {
     return name;
}
----
. Add a *DELETE* request to delete a player:
+
[source,java]
----
@DeleteMapping("/{name}")
public String deletePlayer(@PathVariable String name) {
     return "Player " + name + " deleted";
}
----
. Implement a *PUT* request to update a player's name:
+
[source,java]
----
@PutMapping("/{name}")
public String updatePlayer(@PathVariable String name, @RequestBody String newName) {
     return "Player " + name + " updated to " + newName;
}
----

==== 5. Test the Enhanced API

[arabic]
. Restart your application as explained in the previous step and test
the new endpoints using `+curl+` commands:
* *GET a specific player*:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/players/Ivana%20ANDRES
----
* *POST a new player*:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl --header "Content-Type: application/text" --request POST --data 'Itana BONMATI' http://localhost:8080/players
----
* *PUT to update a player*:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl --header "Content-Type: application/text" --request PUT --data 'Aitana BONMATI' http://localhost:8080/players/Itana%20BONMATI
----
* *DELETE a player*:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl --header "Content-Type: application/text" --request DELETE http://localhost:8080/players/Aitana%20BONMATI
----

You should receive appropriate responses for each operation.

=== Understanding How It Works

By adding the Spring Web dependency, Spring Boot incorporates a Tomcat
server into the application. Tomcat is a popular open-source web server
and servlet container for Java-based applications. The application
listens on port *8080* by default.

* *Annotations*:
** *@RestController*: Flags the class as a RESTful controller.
** *@RequestMapping*: Maps HTTP requests to handler methods.
** *@GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping*:
Specializations of `+@RequestMapping+` for handling respective HTTP
methods.
** *@PathVariable*: Maps part of the URL to the method parameter.
** *@RequestBody*: Maps the request body to the method parameter.

These annotations allow Spring Boot to handle requests seamlessly.

=== Further Learning

While the RESTful endpoint created is simple, it covers essential CRUD
operations. Understanding HTTP status codes and proper response
management is vital for effective API design.

== Defining Responses and the Data Model Exposed by the API

In the previous recipe, we created a simple RESTful API. To enhance the
user experience for consumers of the API, we must incorporate standard
response codes and a consistent data model. In this recipe, we will
improve the RESTful API by returning standard response codes and
defining a data model for our players endpoint.

recipe1-2/end/football</a>
++++
====

=== How to Do It...

We'll create a structured folder hierarchy to organize different class
types. Additionally, we will define a data model to expose in our
RESTful API and create a service that provides the necessary operations
for the API.

All content created in the following steps will be located under the
*src/main/java/com/packt/football* folder or one of its subfolders.
Letâ€™s get started:

==== Step 1: Create the Data Model

[arabic]
. *Create a Folder for the Model*
* Create a folder named *model*.
* Inside this folder, create a file named *Player.java* with the
following content:
+
[source,java]
----
public record Player(String id, int jerseyNumber, String name, String position, LocalDate dateOfBirth) {
}
----

==== Step 2: Create Custom Exceptions

[arabic, start=2]
. *Create a Folder for Exceptions*
* Create a folder named *exceptions*.
* Inside this folder, create two files:
* *AlreadyExistsException.java*:
+
[source,java]
----
package com.packt.football.exceptions;

public class AlreadyExistsException extends RuntimeException {
    public AlreadyExistsException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
----
* *NotFoundException.java*:
+
[source,java]
----
package com.packt.football.exceptions;

public class NotFoundException extends RuntimeException {
    public NotFoundException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}
----

==== Step 3: Create the Service

[arabic, start=3]
. *Create a Folder for Services*
* Create a folder named *services*.
* Inside this folder, create a class named *FootballService*. This class
will manage all operations needed by our RESTful API. Start by defining
the class:
+
[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class FootballService {
    private final Map<String, Player> players = Map.ofEntries(
        Map.entry("1884823", new Player("1884823", 5, "Ivana ANDRES", "Defender", LocalDate.of(1994, 07, 13))),
        Map.entry("325636", new Player("325636", 11, "Alexia PUTELLAS", "Midfielder", LocalDate.of(1994, 02, 04)))
    );

    // List players
    public List<Player> listPlayers() {
        return new ArrayList<>(players.values());
    }

    // Get a player by ID
    public Player getPlayer(String id) {
        Player player = players.get(id);
        if (player == null) {
            throw new NotFoundException("Player not found");
        }
        return player;
    }

    // Add a new player
    public Player addPlayer(Player player) {
        if (players.containsKey(player.id())) {
            throw new AlreadyExistsException("The player already exists");
        } else {
            players.put(player.id(), player);
            return player;
        }
    }

    // Update an existing player
    public Player updatePlayer(Player player) {
        if (!players.containsKey(player.id())) {
            throw new NotFoundException("The player does not exist");
        } else {
            players.put(player.id(), player);
            return player;
        }
    }

    // Delete a player
    public void deletePlayer(String id) {
        players.remove(id);
    }
}
----

==== Step 4: Modify the Player Controller

[arabic, start=4]
. *Update the PlayerController*
* In the *PlayerController* class, modify the controller to utilize the
new service and expose the newly created data model:
+
[source,java]
----
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@RequestMapping("/players")
@RestController
public class PlayerController {
    private final FootballService footballService;

    public PlayerController(FootballService footballService) {
        this.footballService = footballService;
    }

    @GetMapping
    public List<Player> listPlayers() {
        return footballService.listPlayers();
    }

    @GetMapping("/{id}")
    public Player readPlayer(@PathVariable String id) {
        return footballService.getPlayer(id);
    }

    @PostMapping
    public void createPlayer(@RequestBody Player player) {
        footballService.addPlayer(player);
    }

    @PutMapping("/{id}")
    public void updatePlayer(@PathVariable String id, @RequestBody Player player) {
        footballService.updatePlayer(player);
    }

    @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
    public void deletePlayer(@PathVariable String id) {
        footballService.deletePlayer(id);
    }
}
----

==== Step 5: Run the Application

[arabic, start=5]
. *Start the Application*
* In the *application* root folder, open a terminal and execute the
following command to run the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

==== Step 6: Test the Application

[arabic, start=6]
. *Verify Functionality Using curl*
* Test the application by executing the following *curl* command to
retrieve all players:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/players
----
+
Expected output:
+
[source,json]
----
[{"id":"325636","jerseyNumber":11,"name":"Alexia PUTELLAS","position":"Midfielder","dateOfBirth":"1994-02-04"},
 {"id":"1884823","jerseyNumber":5,"name":"Ivana ANDRES","position":"Defender","dateOfBirth":"1994-07-13"}]
----

=== How It Works...

In this recipe, we defined a new record type named *Player*. Spring Boot
automatically serializes this object into a response body that can be
sent to the client in formats such as JSON or XML.

==== About Records

The *record* feature was introduced in Java 16 and provides a convenient
way to declare classes that serve as simple data carriers, automatically
generating methods like *equals()*, *hashCode()*, and *toString()* based
on the record components. This feature simplifies the creation of
classes that primarily encapsulate data. Spring Boot 3 requires Java 17
or higher.

If you have special serialization requirements, you can configure your
own message converter by implementing *WebMvcConfigurer* and overriding
the *configureMessageConverters* method. For more information, refer to
the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/config/annotation/WebMvcConfigurer.html#configureMessageConverters(java.util.List)[Spring
Framework documentation].

==== HTTP Status Codes Handling

Spring Bootâ€™s default handling of HTTP status codes can be summarized as
follows:

* Successful execution returns an *HTTP 200* status.
* Unimplemented methods return a *405 Method Not Allowed* error.
* Requests for non-existent resources yield a *404 Not Found* status.
* Invalid requests return a *400 Bad Request* status.
* In case of exceptions, an *HTTP 500 Internal Server Error* status is
returned.
* Security-related operations may yield *401 Unauthorized* or *403
Forbidden* statuses.

While this behavior may suffice in some scenarios, providing proper
semantics to your RESTful API is advisable. The next recipe will discuss
how to handle these scenarios more effectively.

Note that the *FootballService* class is annotated with *@Service*,
which registers it as a Spring bean and makes it available in the IoC
container. When a Spring Boot application starts, it scans for classes
annotated with various stereotypes, such as *@Service*, *@Controller*,
and *@Bean*. Consequently, when Spring Boot instantiates the
*PlayerController*, it passes an instance of the *FootballService*.

== Managing Errors in a RESTful API

In the previous recipe, we enhanced our RESTful API by using complex
data structures. However, the application wasn't able to handle common
errors or return standard response codes. In this recipe, we will
improve the API by managing common errors and returning consistent
response codes according to standard practices.

====

=== How to Do It

In this recipe, we will modify the RESTful API created previously to
handle exceptions and return appropriate HTTP response codes. All
content created in the following steps will be located under the
*src/main/java/com/packt/football* folder or its subfolders. Letâ€™s get
started:

[arabic]
. *Handle Non-Existing Players* +
Attempting to retrieve a non-existing player or creating the same player
twice will throw an exception, resulting in an HTTP 500 server error:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/players/99999
----
+
Example response:
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "timestamp": "2023-09-16T23:18:41.906+00:00",
    "status": 500,
    "error": "Internal Server Error",
    "path": "/players/99999"
}
----
. *Implement Not Found Handler* +
To manage this error more consistently, add a method named
`+notFoundHandler+` in the *PlayerController* class to handle
`+NotFoundException+` errors:
+
[source,java]
----
@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND, reason = "Not found")
@ExceptionHandler(NotFoundException.class)
public void notFoundHandler() {
}
----
. *Implement Already Exists Handler* +
Next, add another method named `+alreadyExistsHandler+` to manage
`+AlreadyExistsException+` errors:
+
[source,java]
----
@ResponseStatus(value = HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST, reason = "Already exists")
@ExceptionHandler(AlreadyExistsException.class)
public void alreadyExistsHandler() {
}
----
. *Run the Application* +
Open a terminal in the *application* root folder and execute the
following command to run the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----
. *Test the Application* +
Execute the following curl commands to test the error handling:
* To get a player that does not exist:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/players/99999
----
+
Example response:
+
[source,json]
----
{
    "timestamp": "2023-09-16T23:21:39.936+00:00",
    "status": 404,
    "error": "Not Found",
    "path": "/players/99999"
}
----
+
This indicates that our application adheres to standard RESTful API
semantics.
* Verify handling of the `+AlreadyExistsException+` by executing the
following request to create a player twice:
+
[source,bash]
----
data="{'id': '8888', 'jerseyNumber':6, 'name':'Cata COLL', 'position':'Goalkeeper', 'dateOfBirth': '2001-04-23'}"
curl --header "Content-Type: application/json" --request POST --data "$data" http://localhost:8080/players
----
+
The first request will succeed with an HTTP 200 response, while the
second request will return an HTTP 400 response.

=== How It Works

Spring Boot manages HTTP status codes for common cases. This recipe
demonstrates how to handle application-specific scenarios requiring
consistent HTTP status codes. A *404* status code should be returned
when a resource is not found. Instead of returning a null value from the
service, which would result in an HTTP 200 response, we use the
`+@ExceptionHandler+` annotation to define a handler for specific
exceptions and the `+@ResponseStatus+` annotation to specify the HTTP
status code.

=== Thereâ€™s More...

You can control response codes more explicitly by returning a
*ResponseEntity* instead of your data model directly in the controller.
For instance, here's how you can implement the `+getPlayer+` method:

[source,java]
----
@GetMapping("/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<Player> readPlayer(@PathVariable String id) {
    try {
        Player player = footballService.getPlayer(id);
        return new ResponseEntity<>(player, HttpStatus.OK);
    } catch (NotFoundException e) {
        return new ResponseEntity<>(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
    }
}
----

Alternatively, you can create a global handler for all controllers by
using a class annotated with `+@ControllerAdvice+`:

[source,java]
----
package com.packt.football;

@ControllerAdvice
public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
    @ExceptionHandler(NotFoundException.class)
    public ResponseEntity<String> handleGlobalException(NotFoundException ex) {
        return new ResponseEntity<>(ex.getMessage(), HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND);
    }
}
----

Using this approach allows for consistent error handling across all
RESTful endpoints in your application.


== Testing a RESTful API

Testing applications manually can be tedious, especially when handling
complex scenarios that are difficult to validate. Furthermore, manual
testing lacks scalability in terms of development productivity.
Therefore, I highly recommend implementing automated testing.

Spring Boot includes the *Testing starter* by default, which provides
essential components for unit and integration testing. In this guide, we
will learn how to implement a unit test for our RESTful API.

<a href="chapter1/recipe1-4/end/football" target="_blank">
recipe1-4/end/football</a>
++++
====

=== How to Do It

Letâ€™s add some tests to our RESTful API to ensure our application
behaves correctly whenever we make changes:

[arabic]
. *Create a New Test Class*:
* In the *src/test* folder, create a new test class named
*PlayerControllerTest* and annotate it with *@WebMvcTest*:
+
[source,java]
----
@WebMvcTest(value = PlayerController.class)
public class PlayerControllerTest {
}
----
. *Define MockMvc*:
* Add a field of type *MockMvc* and annotate it with *@Autowired*:
+
[source,java]
----
@Autowired
private MockMvc mvc;
----
. *Mock the FootballService*:
* Create another field of type *FootballService* and annotate it with
*@MockBean*.
. *Write the First Test*:
* Create a method named *testListPlayers* to validate the behavior of
our RESTful API when returning the list of players:
+
[source,java]
----
@Test
public void testListPlayers() throws Exception {
}
----
* Ensure this method is annotated with *@Test*.
. *Configure the FootballService*:
* Inside the *testListPlayers* method, configure the *FootballService*
to return a list of two players when invoking the *listPlayers* method:
+
[source,java]
----
Player player1 = new Player("1884823", 5, "Ivana ANDRES", "Defender", LocalDate.of(1994, 07, 13));
Player player2 = new Player("325636", 11, "Alexia PUTELLAS", "Midfielder", LocalDate.of(1994, 02, 04));
List<Player> players = List.of(player1, player2);
given(footballService.listPlayers()).willReturn(players);
----
. *Emulate HTTP Calls*:
* Use the *mvc* field to perform the HTTP GET request and validate its
behavior:
+
[source,java]
----
MvcResult result = mvc.perform(MockMvcRequestBuilders
        .get("/players")
        .accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))
        .andExpect(status().isOk())
        .andExpect(MockMvcResultMatchers.jsonPath("$", hasSize(2)))
        .andReturn();
----
. *Perform Additional Validations*:
* Validate that the returned array of players is as expected:
+
[source,java]
----
String json = result.getResponse().getContentAsString();
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
mapper.registerModule(new JavaTimeModule());
List<Player> returnedPlayers = mapper.readValue(json,
        mapper.getTypeFactory().constructCollectionType(List.class, Player.class));
assertArrayEquals(players.toArray(), returnedPlayers.toArray());
----
. *Test Error Management*:
* Create a new method named *testReadPlayer_doesnt_exist* in the
*PlayerControllerTest* class and annotate it with *@Test*:
+
[source,java]
----
@Test
public void testReadPlayer_doesnt_exist() throws Exception {
}
----
. *Configure Error Handling*:
* Arrange the *getPlayer* method of the *FootballService* to throw a
*NotFoundException* for a non-existent player:
+
[source,java]
----
String id = "1884823";
given(footballService.getPlayer(id)).willThrow(new NotFoundException("Player not found"));
----
. *Simulate the Request and Validate*:
* Use the *mvc* field to simulate the request and validate the expected
behavior:
+
[source,java]
----
mvc.perform(MockMvcRequestBuilders.get("/players/" + id).accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON))
      .andExpect(status().isNotFound());
----
. *Execute the Tests*:
* Run the tests using the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
mvn test
----
* The *test* goal is automatically executed whenever you run the
*package* or *install* goals unless explicitly disabled. You can also
execute the tests from your preferred IDE.

=== How It Works

By default, Spring Initializr includes a dependency for
*spring-boot-starter-test*, which provides all necessary components for
testing. Here are some key elements used in this recipe:

* *@WebMvcTest*: This annotation configures the testing class to focus
only on MVC components, disabling default Spring Boot autoconfiguration.
* *@MockBean*: This annotation allows you to create a mock
implementation of *FootballService*, replacing any existing bean
registration.
* *given*: This method helps specify behavior for mocked methods, such
as setting return values.
* *MockMvc*: This simulates web server behavior, enabling you to test
controllers without deploying the application.

In this recipe, we also utilized JUnit utilities like
*assertArrayEquals* to compare arrays.


=== See Also

In this book, I apply the *Arrange-Act-Assert* (*AAA*) principles when
writing tests:

* *Arrange*: Set up the conditions needed for the test.
* *Act*: Perform the action being tested.
* *Assert*: Verify that the expected results were achieved.

Additionally, the *Arrange-Act-Assert-Clean* (*AAAC*) variant includes a
cleanup step, which ideally shouldn't be necessary if you mock
components or services that require cleanup.


== Using OpenAPI to Document Our RESTful API

Now that we have a RESTful API, we can create a consumer application.
Instead of simply performing HTTP requests and requiring consumers to
understand our applicationâ€™s codebase, we can use OpenAPI. OpenAPI is a
standard for documenting RESTful APIs and can generate client
applications across different languages and frameworks. Spring Boot has
excellent support for OpenAPI.

In this guide, weâ€™ll learn how to add OpenAPI support to our RESTful API
and use the tools it provides for consumption.

====


NOTE: OpenAPI 3.0 is the new name for Swagger after it was donated by
SmartBear to the OpenAPI Initiative. Many resources may still refer to
OpenAPI as Swagger.


=== How to Do It

Letâ€™s document our RESTful API with OpenAPI and start testing it using
the OpenAPI user interface.

==== Step 1: Add OpenAPI Dependency

[arabic]
. Open the *pom.xml* file of your RESTful API project.
. Add the SpringDoc OpenAPI Starter WebMVC UI dependency by inserting
the following XML into the `+<dependencies>+` element:
+
[source,xml]
----
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springdoc</groupId>
        <artifactId>springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui</artifactId>
        <version>2.2.0</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----
+

CAUTION: For brevity, I have removed other dependencies from the
code snippet, but ensure you keep all of them in your code.


==== Step 2: Run the Application

[arabic, start=3]
. Execute your application and navigate to the following URLs in your
browser:
* *http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs*: This URL returns the description
of your RESTful API in OpenAPI format.
* *http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html*: This URL provides a
user-friendly interface to interact with your API.

==== Step 3: Interact with Your API

[arabic, start=4]
. You will see that all the RESTful operations defined in your
application and the data model (e.g., *Player*) are exposed. You can
execute any of the available operations directly from the browser.

=== How It Works

The *org.springdoc:springdoc-openapi-starter-webmvc-ui* dependency
inspects your application at runtime to generate the descriptions of the
available endpoints. The core of OpenAPI is the service definition found
at *http://localhost:8080/v3/api-docs*. This JSON document follows the
OpenAPI schema and describes the RESTful endpoints hosted in your
application, including paths, HTTP methods, parameters, responses, and
data schemas.

Additionally, the OpenAPI dependency provides a user-friendly UI that
utilizes the OpenAPI schema, allowing for easy interaction with the
service. This can serve as an alternative to using `+curl+` for testing
the RESTful service, eliminating the need to memorize all possible
arguments.


== Consuming a RESTful API from Another Spring Boot Application Using FeignClient

In this guide, we will learn how to create a consumer application for a
RESTful API using FeignClient. While there are various tools available
to generate client code from the OpenAPI specification, we will manually
create the client code for educational purposes.

====

We will create a new Spring Boot application using the Spring Initializr
tool: https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr].

=== Steps to Create the Consumer Application

Weâ€™ll create a Spring Boot application that consumes the Football
RESTful API from the previous recipe:

[arabic]
. *Create a New Spring Boot Application*:
* Open https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr].
* Use the same parameters as in the _Creating a RESTful API_ recipe, but
modify the following options:
** *Artifact*: `+albums+`
** *Dependencies*: Select *Spring Web* and *OpenFeign*.
. *Download and Set Up the Project*:
* Generate the project, download the ZIP file, and extract it.
* Open the *pom.xml* file.
. *Create the `+Player+` Record*:
* Create a new record named `+Player+` with the following code:
+
[source,java]
----
public record Player(String id, Integer jerseyNumber,
                     String name, String position,
                     LocalDate dateOfBirth) {
}
----
. *Create the `+FootballClient+` Interface*:
* Create an interface named `+FootballClient+` and add the following
code:
+
[source,java]
----
@FeignClient(name = "football", url = "http://localhost:8080")
public interface FootballClient {
    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/players")
    List<Player> getPlayers();
}
----
. *Create the `+AlbumsController+`*:
* Create a controller named `+AlbumsController.java+` with the following
code:
+
[source,java]
----
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/albums")
public class AlbumsController {
    private final FootballClient footballClient;

    public AlbumsController(FootballClient footballClient) {
        this.footballClient = footballClient;
    }

    @GetMapping("/players")
    public List<Player> getPlayers() {
        return footballClient.getPlayers();
    }
}
----
. *Modify the `+AlbumsApplication+` Class*:
* Update the `+AlbumsApplication+` class by adding the
`+@EnableFeignClients+` annotation:
+
[source,java]
----
@EnableFeignClients
@SpringBootApplication
public class AlbumsApplication {
}
----
. *Run the Application*:
* Execute the application by running the following command in your
terminal:
+
[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=--server.port=8081
----
+
This command runs the application on port *8081* to avoid conflicts with
the existing API running on port *8080*.
. *Test the Application*:
* Use the following curl command to test the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8081/albums/players
----
+
You should receive a response similar to this:
+
[source,json]
----
[{"id":"1884823","jerseyNumber":5,"name":"Ivana ANDRES","position":"Defender","dateOfBirth":"1994-07-13"},
{"id":"325636","jerseyNumber":11,"name":"Alexia PUTELLAS","position":"Midfielder","dateOfBirth":"1994-02-04"}]
----

=== Explanation

Feign is a *declarative* web service client framework that simplifies
the process of making HTTP requests to RESTful web services. To create a
Feign client, define an *interface* that specifies the HTTP requests you
want to make to a particular service. The methods in this interface are
annotated with HTTP method annotations like *@RequestMapping*,
*@GetMapping*, *@PostMapping*, etc., to specify the HTTP method and the
URL path.

By injecting the Feign client interface into your Spring components, you
can make HTTP requests effortlessly. Spring Cloud Feign automatically
generates and executes the HTTP requests based on your interface
definition. The `+@EnableFeignClients+` annotation in the application
class allows the framework to scan for interfaces with the
*@FeignClient* annotation and generate the necessary client code.

In the controller, you can then utilize the Feign client via Spring Boot
dependency injection.

=== Additional Information

While Feign is used in this example for its seamless integration with
Spring Cloud components (like Eureka Server), there are other
alternatives available for making HTTP requests. The manual approach we
took is beneficial for learning, but in practice, tools can help
maintain client-side code in sync with server descriptions. Here are two
useful tools:

* *OpenAPI Generator*:
https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator[OpenAPITools]
* *Swagger Codegen*:
https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen[swagger-api/swagger-codegen]

Both tools offer command-line interfaces and Maven plugins for
generating client-side code based on OpenAPI descriptions.

== Consuming a RESTful API from Another Spring Boot Application Using RestClient

In this guide, we will leverage the new `+RestClient+` component
introduced in Spring Framework 6.1 and available in Spring Boot starting
from version 3.2. This approach provides a fluent API that abstracts
HTTP libraries, enabling easy conversion between Java objects and HTTP
requests/responses.

=== Steps to Create the Application

[arabic]
. *Create a New Spring Boot Application*:
* Open https://start.spring.io[Spring Initializr] in your browser.
* Use the same parameters as in the _Creating a RESTful API_ recipe, but
update the following:
** For *Artifact*, enter *albums*
** For *Dependencies*, select *Spring Web*
. *Create a Configuration Class*:
* Create a configuration class named *AlbumsConfiguration*. In this
class, define a `+RestClient+` bean:
+
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
public class AlbumsConfiguration {
    @Value("${football.api.url:http://localhost:8080}")
    String baseURI;

    @Bean
    RestClient restClient() {
        return RestClient.create(baseURI);
    }
}
----
+

NOTE: The `+@Value+` annotation allows you to configure the URL of the
remote server.

. *Create a Service Class*:
* Create a service class named *FootballClientService*. This class will
inject the `+RestClient+` bean via the constructor:
+
[source,java]
----
@Service
public class FootballClientService {
    private final RestClient restClient;

    public FootballClientService(RestClient restClient) {
        this.restClient = restClient;
    }
}
----
. *Retrieve Data from the Remote API*:
* Implement a method named *getPlayers* to retrieve a list of players:
+
[source,java]
----
public List<Player> getPlayers() {
    return restClient.get().uri("/players").retrieve()
        .body(new ParameterizedTypeReference<List<Player>>() {});
}
----
. *Retrieve a Single Player*:
* Create a method to get a single player by ID:
+
[source,java]
----
public Optional<Player> getPlayer(String id) {
    return restClient.get().uri("/players/{id}", id)
        .exchange((request, response) -> {
            if (response.getStatusCode().equals(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)) {
                return Optional.empty();
            }
            return Optional.of(response.bodyTo(Player.class));
        });
}
----
. *Create an Album RESTful API*:
* Finally, implement an Album RESTful API using the
*FootballClientService*. A sample version is available in the bookâ€™s
GitHub repository.

=== How It Works

This recipe utilizes the `+RestClient+` without creating additional
types to replicate the remote RESTful API. The `+RestClient+` allows us
to perform requests using a fluent API style, creating readable and
maintainable code.

==== Detailed Explanation of `+getPlayer+`

* We start with the `+get()+` method, which initializes the request
properties (e.g., URI, headers).
* The `+uri()+` method sets the endpoint, which appends to the base URL
defined in *AlbumsConfiguration*.
* The `+exchange()+` method performs the call and provides a handler for
the response.
* In the response handler, we handle the case where the player is not
found by returning an empty `+Optional+`. Otherwise, we deserialize the
response using `+bodyTo()+`, passing the `+Player+` class.

The `+getPlayers+` method is similar but returns a `+List<Player>+`. To
specify the generic type, we use `+ParameterizedTypeReference+`,
creating an inline subclass for deserialization.

==== Configuration Properties

We use the `+@Value+` annotation in *AlbumsConfiguration* to inject
values from external sources (e.g., configuration files, environment
variables). The expression `+${football.api.url:http://localhost:8080}+`
means it will attempt to read the `+football.api.url+` property first;
if not found, it defaults to `+http://localhost:8080+`.

The format of properties will differ based on whether they are in
*application.properties* or *application.yml*:

* *application.properties*:
+
....
football.api.url=http://localhost:8080
....
* *application.yml*:
+
[source,yaml]
----
football:
  api:
    url: http://localhost:8080
----

In this book, most examples will use the *application.yml* format,
though *application.properties* may also appear, especially in the
context of environment variables.

== Mocking a RESTful API with WireMock

In this guide, we'll learn how to mock a remote RESTful API service
using WireMock. Mocking is helpful as it allows you to test your
application in isolation, without needing the actual remote service to
be available. This is particularly useful for handling unreliable or
slow services, or when you want to simulate various scenarios that may
be hard to recreate with the actual service.

=== Steps to Mock the API

Follow these steps to set up WireMock for mocking the remote Football
service in your Albums application:

==== 1. Add WireMock Dependency

Open your *pom.xml* file and add the following dependency to include
WireMock in your project:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.tomakehurst</groupId>
    <artifactId>wiremock-standalone</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.1</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
----

==== 2. Create Test Class

Create a new test class named *FootballClientServiceTest*. Use the
*@SpringBootTest* annotation to specify a property for the remote server
address:

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootTest(properties = { "football.api.url=http://localhost:7979" })
public class FootballClientServiceTests {
}
----

==== 3. Set Up WireMock Server

Inside your *FootballClientServiceTest* class, set up the WireMock
server:

[source,java]
----
private static WireMockServer wireMockServer;

@BeforeAll
static void init() {
    wireMockServer = new WireMockServer(7979);
    wireMockServer.start();
    WireMock.configureFor(7979);
}
----

==== 4. Autowire FootballClientService

Declare a field for *FootballClientService* and annotate it with
*@Autowired*:

[source,java]
----
@Autowired
FootballClientService footballClientService;
----

==== 5. Write a Test for `+getPlayer+`

[arabic]
. Create a test method named *getPlayerTest*:

[source,java]
----
@Test
public void getPlayerTest() {
----

[arabic, start=2]
. Arrange the expected response from the remote service by stubbing it:

[source,java]
----
WireMock.stubFor(WireMock.get(WireMock.urlEqualTo("/players/325636"))
    .willReturn(WireMock.aResponse()
    .withHeader("Content-Type", "application/json")
    .withBody("""
        {
            "id": "325636",
            "jerseyNumber": 11,
            "name": "Alexia PUTELLAS",
            "position": "Midfielder",
            "dateOfBirth": "1994-02-04"
        }
    """)));
----

[arabic, start=3]
. Call the *getPlayer* method:

[source,java]
----
Optional<Player> player = footballClientService.getPlayer("325636");
----

[arabic, start=4]
. Validate the results:

[source,java]
----
Player expectedPlayer = new Player("325636", 11, "Alexia PUTELLAS", "Midfielder", LocalDate.of(1994, 2, 4));
assertEquals(expectedPlayer, player.get());
----

==== 6. Additional Tests

As an exercise, consider creating tests for other methods of the
*FootballClientService* class. You can also simulate different server
responses. More example tests can be found in the bookâ€™s GitHub
repository.

=== How It Works

WireMock is a powerful library for API mock testing and can be used
standalone or integrated into a project. In this recipe, we added it as
a test dependency to avoid conflicts with the production environment.

We configured the WireMock server to listen on port *7979*, which
matches the property we set in the *@SpringBootTest* annotation. This
ensures that the tests can run without interference from any real remote
services.

The `+StubFor+` method allows us to define the expected behavior of the
mock server, enabling us to test our application logic against
predefined responses.
